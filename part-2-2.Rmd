# Added locality field manually

# Issue with above is that rents are not inflation-adjusted. May need to revisit. I've requested from CoStar to allow for an inflation-adjusted average rent per unit pull, BUT who knows if they can add it.

```


```{r avg-rent-br}

```{r rents-built}

# Aggregated average market asking rent per unit for Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico, and Richmond City.

# Not easily done in CoStar; first filter at max year 1979; then do 1980 to 1999, then 2000 to 2009, then 2010 and beyond
