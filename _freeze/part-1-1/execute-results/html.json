The most populous locality, Chesterfield County, experienced a near eight percent increase in its population during this timeframe.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percent change in population by locality](part-1-1_files/figure-html/fig-total-pop-plot-1.png){#fig-total-pop-plot width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Components of population change\n\nIn recent years, nearly two thirds of growth could be attributed to either domestic or international migration into the region. But between 2020 and 2021, that share increased to over three quarters---reducing the portion of the population growing due to natural increase to only 13 percent.\n\nThe region's growth continues to be driven primarily by new people coming from other parts of the state and nation (64 percent of growth between 2020 and 2021).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Components of population change](part-1-1_files/figure-html/fig-components-plot-1.png){#fig-components-plot width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Population projections\n\nBetween 2020 and 2050, the region is expected to grow by nearly a third (29 percent)---reaching 1,338,306 residents.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Population projections](part-1-1_files/figure-html/fig-forecasts-region-plot-1.png){#fig-forecasts-region-plot width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver the next 30 years, Chesterfield County will continue to lead growth across the region. By 2050, Chesterfield is expected to surpass half a million residents, growing by 38 percent from the 2020 Census estimates.\n\nPopulation growth trends will largely continue as they have with Hanover County experiencing the second greatest growth from their 2020 estimates (27 percent increase). Henrico County follows with a 26 percent increase (+88,565), while the City of Richmond will only increase by about a fifth (20 percent) over 30 years.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Population projections by locality](part-1-1_files/figure-html/fig-forecasts-locality-plot-1.png){#fig-forecasts-locality-plot width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
