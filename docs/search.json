One potential explanation for the notable decreases in the number of three- and four-person renter households is lower ACS response rates among younger adults living with roommates during COVID-19. This population, which does not include college students living in dorms (“group quarters” are not households in Census methodology), was likely to move back home with parents during the initial phases of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Change in household size by tenure"

Families with children were the least common group of homeowners that grew.\nThe only group of renters that saw significant growth was nonfamily households. This includes both renters that live alone and those that live with non-related roommates.

The share of multigenerational households in Chesterfield and Richmond appears to be decreasing slightly, while increasing slightly in the outer counties. The share of Henrico’s population in multigenerational households continues to sit around 8 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Percent of population living in multiple generation households"

This is more than any other arrangement. However, since 2016, the fastest growing living arrangement for young adults has been with an unmarried partner, followed by other nonrelatives (roommates). In fact, the share of young adults now living with a married spouse increased slightly more than the share still living with parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Change in 18-34 year old population by living arrangement"

This growth can likely be attributed to both new high-income residents from outside the region, as well as income growth among households already in the region.\nThere was also a minor increase in the number of middle-income renters earning between $50,000 and $100,000, reflecting continued demand for new market-rate apartments—along with affordable starter homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Change households by tenure and income level\n\n\n\n\nAverage homeowner incomes continue to be well above average renter incomes across the region. When adjusted for inflation, incomes across tenures for each locality show very minor to modest growth. Incomes in the city—for both homeowners and renters—remain significantly below those in the surrounding counties. The average household income for homeowners in the counties is around three times that of renters in Richmond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Median houshold income by tenure and locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Incomes by race and ethnicity\nAverage incomes in the region remain unequal by race and ethnicity. Households with the highest incomes include Asian and white, non-Hispanic residents in the counties—earning well above $75,000.

Throughout the region, non-family households (i.e., persons living alone or with unrelated persons) consistently have average incomes below $50,000. In Henrico and Chesterfield counties, families living with and without children under 18 have very similar income levels.

This dataset provides a rich look into wage distribution by industry and occupation.\nHowever, OEWS is only available at the national, state, and metro levels. Therefore, the data below covers the full Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) rather than the (smaller) PHA region.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Wage change by percentile\nWhile regional wages increased across the board from May 2019 to May 2021, the largest percent increases in average wages were among jobs that paid at and below the median wage. In fact, the largest growth occurred in the lowest 10th percentile of wages, due in large part to state lawmakers adopting incremental increases to Virginia’s minimum wage in 2020. The first increase from $7.25 to $9.50 per hour took effect in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nToday, state minimum wage is $11.00 per hour. Under current law, it will increase again to $12.00 in 2023. Lawmakers must reenact the measure by July 2024 to initiative further increases to $15.00 per hour by 2026.\n\n\nAnother factor in this low-end wage growth is likely the increased pay offered by many businesses, especially in the food, retail, and accommodation sectors, to encourage workers to return during the COVID-19 recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Percent change in annual wage in Richmond, VA MSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Wage change by occupation\nOver this same period, wages in the region grew for four of the five most common occupation categories by total employment numbers. Workers in the Transportation and Material Moving sector saw the largest increases—from an average annual salary of $30,250 to $36,370 (over 20 percent).\nJobs in Food Preparation and Serving, Sales, and Business and Financial Operations sectors—totaling more than 162,000 workers in the region as of May 2021—also saw wage growth, but less than the 13.3 percent average increase. Meanwhile, wages among Office and Administrative Support positions remained nearly the same (-0.2 percent) from 2019 to 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Percent change in annual wage for top 5 most common occupation categories"

The largest increases occurred among young adults under 35, as well as “young” seniors between 65 and 74. The latter group will see their needs increase acutely in the next decade as they continue to age and potentially become more dependent on others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Net change in individuals with independent living difficulties by age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 By tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe detailed estimates for persons with independent living difficulties in this and the next section are not available from the standard ACS tables published by the Census Bureau.

Most are in homes that they own, or in homes owned by another occupant, such as a spouse.

From 2016 to 2020, owner-occupied housing has increased by 17,436—an increase of seven percent. Unsurprisingly, much of that growth (93 percent) has occurred in the single-family home market, including detached and attached homes.

However, there have also been thousands of net additions among homes built before 1940 and between 1980 and 2009.

At the same time, homeowner households have become smaller, which creates a surplus of largely unused bedrooms across the market.\nSmaller housing options exist largely in the City of Richmond or Henrico County. While single-family homes—or condo units—with one- or two- bedrooms are usually much more affordable, these housing options are often in older, but highly desirable neighborhoods in the City of Richmond (i.e., The Fan and Church Hill).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in owner-occupied housing units by number of bedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Production\nAll localities in the region experienced single-family construction declines as a result of the Great Recession from late 2007 to early 2012 — especially Chesterfield and Henrico.

From 2010 to 2020, single-family home construction has gone from 545 units to 2,202 per year in a decade — a 300% increase. Although Chesterfield County was on its way to pre-Recession levels, all other localities are seeing slow growth in the single-family home construction space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family building permits"

The greatest price increases have occurred in the City of Richmond during 2022, where the median home price went from $303,941 in February to $389,950 in June, a 28 percent increase. Home prices are continuing to trend upward in spite of rising mortgage interest rates.\nHanover County remains the most expensive locality in the region with a median home price of $464,000 in July 2022, followed by the Chesterfield County ($378,671), Henrico County ($370,000), and the City of Richmond ($352,500).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly median sales price by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Supply\nThe inventory of for-sale housing before the pandemic typically sat at two months or more—meaning that it would take two or more months to sell at current prices. A healthy level of supply has said to be five or six months worth, but in recent years the region has been below that, which indicates a strong seller’s market.\nWhen pandemic began in March 2020, months supply dropped to two months and then by June 2020 hit a low of one month and has sat squarely there ever since. Even amid rising interest rates in 2022 and talks of a housing slump, months supply continues to remain low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonths of supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Starter homes\nStarter homes provide young adults the ability to get on the first rung of the homeownership ladder. This allows many young adults the ability to build equity before their household grows (i.e. marriage and children). But starter homes are becoming more and more scarce. This has largely because those starter home opportunities are not coming to market. In some cases, older homes occupied by seniors are not hitting the market because senior desire to age-in-place remains high or seniors simply cannot find other affordable options themselves. Starter homes are also ripe for investor flipping, which leaves first-time homebuyers competing with all cash offers.\nIn addition, smaller homes do not make up a significant share of new construction stock. Smaller homes (two-bedroom or less) are often more desirable among seniors and young adults without children. The lack of this stock prevents the movement of households from different rungs along the homeownership ladder — locking homeowners into homes that often no longer work for them.\nIn 2021, the Virginia REALTORS® (VAR) conducted an analysis of the number and share of starter homes sold in Virginia from 2013 to mid-2021. This analysis was included in the statewide housing study conducted by HousingForward Virginia as part of HB 854. To calculate the number and share of starter homes sold, VAR calculated the number of homes sold that would be affordable to a household making 80 percent of AMI.\nFor the region, the share of starter homes sold has been in a steady decline. The greatest decrease has occurred in Chesterfield County, where the share of starter homes sold has gone from 63 percent to 46 percent. The smallest decreased occurred in Henrico County, a decrease of only 8 percentage points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of sold homes affordable to 80% AMI"

But since the start of the pandemic, the median resale home price has risen above the $300,000 mark and in June 2022 reached a high of $371,250.\nDuring this timeframe, new construction median home prices have remained above $350,000 and throughout 2022 so far have stayed above $400,000. On average, there is a $89,127 difference between new construction and resale sales price—leaving new construction significantly out of reach for lower income households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian price of new construction and resale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Bedrooms\nThe majority of home sales in the region have been for three- and four-bedroom homes — roughly three in four homes sold in the past five years. Nuances exist at either end of the bedroom spectrum.\nNew construction of homes with one- to two-bedrooms has been increasing — going from six percent of sales in 2017 to nine percent in 2022 YTD. At the other end, new construction of five or more bedroom homes has increased as well with an increase of three percent (15 percent of sales in 2017 to 18 percent in 2022 YTD). For resale homes, the share of homes by bedroom has remained largely unchanged each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of bedrooms by new construction and resales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Size\nIn the past five years, there have been clear differences in new construction and resale sales by square footage. The majority of resale homes have been under 2,000 square feet, while new construction is overwhelmingly over 2,000 square feet. These differences have clear implications on home prices (i.e. more square footage means higher prices). But across the region, minimum requirements set out by localities in zoning ordinances impact these builder decisions.\nBuilding smaller homes is less profitable given the rising cost to develop a single detached home (e.g. rising land, infrastructure, and regulatory costs). In order to maximize profit, home builders need to increase square footage to recoup costs and meet development requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome size by new construction and resales"

    "text": "6.1 Supply\n\n6.1.1 Change in stock\nWhile many renters across the region do live in multifamily buildings (with 5 or more units), the second largest share of rental housing is single-family housing (either attached or detached). In 2020, over a third (37 percent) of rental housing in the region consisted of single-family housing, while 49 percent was located in buildings with 5 or more units. There has been little change in these percentages since 2016.\nChanges in the shares of rental housing have been small — but those changes have been among rental housing with 20 or more units (17 percent in 2016 to 19 percent in 2020) and 2 to 4 unit buildings (14 percent in 2016 down to 13 percent in 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Change in share of renter-occupied housing units by structure type\n\n\n\n\nThe raw changes in rental housing were most felt in Henrico County and the City of Richmond. In Henrico, there was a 1,930 increase in single-family rental housing and a 1,357 decrease in 2 to 4 unit rental housing (i.e. duplexes, triplexes, and quads).\nThe City of Richmond saw a contrasting decrease in single-family rentals (-1,921), while also experiencing a 2,134 increase in rental housing located in buildings with 20 or more units. Chesterfield County has seen slight increases in multifamily housing of all types, while Hanover County has not seen much change at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Change in renter-occupied housing units by structure type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Age of stock\nSince 2016, the region has seen major changes in the age of its rental stock as existing homes transition from being owned to leased out, or vice-versa. Of note, every locality except for Hanover saw significant increases in the number of renter-occupied homes built between 1980 and 1999.\nThese homes—now over 20 years old—are likely becoming the target of investors purchasing from homeowners, making certain improvements, and renting them out. In Henrico County, this trend was even more prevalent among homes built between 1960 and 1979.\nConversely, Chesterfield and Henrico each had over 1,000 homes built between 2000 and 2009 change from renter- to owner-occupied. The largest losses in rental stock, however, occurred in Richmond among homes built prior to 1980. Several factors could explain this decline:\n\nActual demolition of very old, low-quality homes,\nDuplexes and triplexes converted into single-family homes, and\nSingle-family rentals purchased by buyers who now live in the home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Change in renter-occupied housing units by year built\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Bedrooms\nRental homes in the Richmond region are most likely to have one or two bedrooms. While the number of one-bedroom apartments has continued to increase (+1,617) from 2016, the number of two-bedroom units has decreased by 2,500.\nThe increasing supply of one-bedroom apartments coincides with a similar increase in studio apartments—these unit sizes reflect new apartments, largely in Richmond, marketed for college students and other young adults.\nThe dwindling number of two-bedroom rental homes may reflect small single-family rentals in older neighborhoods transitioning to owner-occupancy, as there is a similar (but much less significant) decline in three-bedroom units.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Change in renter-occupied housing units by number of bedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Production\nConstruction of multifamily properties (with 5 units or more) has been sporadic since the end of the Great Recession. In all localities aside from Hanover County, there have been waves and dips in the multifamily building construction. Hanover has seen little to no activity throughout the last two decades, while Chesterfield County and Richmond have seen the bulk of activity.\nDuring the latter half of the last decade, Chesterfield County had a boom in multifamily construction — nearing 1,500 units in 2019. Meanwhile, Richmond’s multifamily construction saw dips following the Great Recession and again in 2018, but has largely been up in the last couple years of the 2010s. Although Henrico County had dips in 2016 and 2018, multifamily construction has more often than not been above the 700 unit mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Multifamily building permits"

With eviction moratoriums and a flow of rental assistance, low supply gave way to historic rent increases. The average market asking rent in the region reached a two-decade high of $1,395 in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Average asking rent\n\n\n\n\nLarge quarterly increases in average rents began in early 2021 and have continued to the present. From the first to second quarters of this year, rents increased by $31. However, this relative growth was very near the change in inflation over that same period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Quarterly change in average asking rent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Rents by submarket\nAlthough not adjusted for inflation, rents by submarket show that there are distinct average rents across the region. Since 2010, the steepest increases have occurred in the counties. Northside Richmond remains the least expensive submarket with an average rent of $1,037 in the second quarter of this year, while Midlothian is the most expensive at $1,655.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Average asking rent by submarket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Rents by bedrooms\nRents in the region have risen the most among three-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, reflecting continued demand for units that have actually declined in supply since 2016. In contrast, average rents for studio and one-bedroom apartments—which grew by more than 2,700 units since 2016—have increased less than $100 over the last decade when adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Average asking rent by bedroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Rents by age of units\nRecently constructed rental housing (built in 2010 and after) leads average asking rents at $1,614. As expected, rental costs correlate to the period in which they were built — with older rental housing being less expensive. Pre-1980 rental housing is roughly $400 cheaper than more recent rental housing.\nIn the last decade, more recent rental housing had steady and modest increases; only increasing $80 from Q1 2012 to Q2 2022. But older rental housing had much more dramatic increases; increasing an average of $257 in that same time period.\nRental housing built between 1980 and 2009 had especially steep increases during the height of the pandemic (Q1 2020 to Q3 2021). In this time, the average asking rent increased by over $130, while rent increases for newer rental housing and pre-1980 housing increased by less than $100.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Average asking rent by age of unit"

    "text": "7.1 Affordable rental housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of federal housing assistance programs help low-income residents across the region with rental housing opportunities. Today, there are approximately 25,969 dedicated affordable rental homes found across 240 properties in the Richmond area. These include units both currently occupied and in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding sources\n\n\n\nIn the Richmond region, many affordable rental properties also receive assistance from the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, as well as local sources such as CDBG and HOME grants. The City of Richmond also awards funding to affordable rental projects with its own trust fund. These awards often fill a financing “gap” and do not provide a majority of the total assistance for a development; as a result, they are not specifically reflected in the data.\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Subsidy types\nOver half (51 percent) of all affordable rental homes in the region rely solely on the LIHTC program. Another 31 percent have layered multiple subsidies together, reflecting the capital and funding requirements needed to develop new affordable housing.\nThe other significant source of dedicated affordable housing continues to be more than 3,600 Public Housing units managed by Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDescriptions of each rental assistance program are available on the NHPD website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Share of federally assisted units by subsidy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Layered subsidies\nIn an effort to maximize assistance, rental subsidy programs are often layered together into single projects. Among the 8,061 units with multiple subsidies, over half have either a 4% or 9% LIHTC tax credit—or both “twinned” together. Section 8 Housing Finance and Development Agency (HFDA) New Construction and Loan Management Set-Aside (LMSA) programs are also common types.\n“Other” subsidies generally include HUD insurance programs and other, less common, Section 8 programs. Still, these minor assistance packages nevertheless provide helping subsidy to almost three-in-four units with multiple affordability contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1:  Active subsidies in units with mutiple subsidies \n \n  \n    Detailed subsidy type \n    Units with subsidy \n    Percent of total \n  \n \n\n  \n    LIHTC 4% Tax Credit \n    4,747 \n    58.9% \n  \n  \n    LIHTC 9% Tax Credit \n    4,371 \n    54.2% \n  \n  \n    Section 8 HFDA/8 NC \n    1,584 \n    19.7% \n  \n  \n    Section 8 LMSA \n    1,173 \n    14.6% \n  \n  \n    Other \n    5,880 \n    72.9% \n  \n\n\n Note: Totals do not add to 100% because units are percent of all 8,061 units with multiple subsidies.

While Chesterfield and Henrico counties both have similar amounts of LIHTC-only units, Henrico has nearly 2,900 additional units supported by multiple subsidies—generally combinations of LIHTC and a Section 8 program.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Federally assisted units by subsidy and locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Changes since 2020\nSince January 2020, the region has seen 57 new rental subsidies added, which increased the number of active affordability contracts on units by 4,393. Over that same period, 17 subsidies ended, affecting 1,633 units. Some properties had multiple subsidies either added or expired. In all, there was a net addition of 2,760 rental affordability contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.2:  Added and removed affordable rental contracts since 2020 \n \n  \n     \n    Subsidies \n    Properties affected \n    Units included \n  \n \n\n  \n    Added \n    57 \n    53 \n    4,393 \n  \n  \n    Removed \n    -17 \n    -16 \n    -1,633 \n  \n  \n    Net change \n    40 \n    37 \n    2,760 \n  \n\n\n Sources: National Housing Preservation Database and Virginia Housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew LIHTC units (net 2,129) comprised the majority of added affordable rentals, followed by Section 8 contracts (net 1,132). Net losses of affordable rental contracts occurred in projects supported by HOME funding and HUD insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Additions and removals of subsidized rental units\n\n\n\n\nWhile LIHTC additions drove new affordable supply in Richmond and Chesterfield, new (or renewed) Section 8 contracts covered more than 400 units in Henrico. Over 500 units in Richmond and Henrico saw HUD insurance contracts expire; however, many of these are in projects with another form of rental assistance that has not expired.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Net change in subsidized rental unit contracts by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.5 LIHTC preservation\nLIHTC properties have a 30 year commitment to affordability, but only a 15 year compliance period, wherein property owners can increase rents. Nonprofit developers will often seek new allocation of tax credits before their commitment period ends, but there is often little incentive for for-profit developers to maintain affordability restrictions past the compliance period.\nBy 2040, a large portion of active LIHTC units will be outside the 30 year commitment period — even far more will be outside the 15 year compliance period. Just over 13,000 LIHTC units will be beyond the 30 year commitment period by 2040, which accounts for well over half of all active LIHTC units as of early 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Percent of active LIHTC units by end of commitment period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.6 Public Housing\nThe redevelopment of public housing in the City of Richmond has begun to take shape at the first of the “Big Six” public housing courts — Creighton Court. This public housing property located in Richmond’s far East End consisted of 504 public housing units.\nAs part of their first phase of redevelopment, RRHA has begun demolition of Creighton Court, with plans to develop roughly 700 units of mixed-income housing. Construction on Phase 1 is expected to begin in Winter 2022 with the entire redevelopment process expected to last ten years.\nRRHA’s next focus area will be Gilpin Court, north of Jackson Ward, where about 780 public housing units reside. In November 2021, RRHA and the City of Richmond were awarded a Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for $450,000.\nThis planning grant is being utilized to facilitate the community planning process around not only Gilpin Court, but the Jackson Ward community — including strategies to undo the negative impacts of interstate development on the historically Black communities of Jackson Ward and North Jackson Ward.\n\nNet change in units for public housing redevelopment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic housing community\nOriginal units\nReplacement units\nNet change\n\n\n\n\nCreighton Court\n504\n700\n+196\n\n\nGilpin Court\n780\nTBD\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding for Public Housing redevelopment\n\n\n\nFederal housing policy has guided public housing authorities to use newer funding streams to redevelop older public housing communities.

This provides household with greater choice in where they want to live, but historically many HCV recipients have faced discrimination from landlords unwilling to accept HCV.\nThis changed significantly in early 2020, when the Virginia General Assembly passed new fair housing legislation that made it illegal to discriminate based on source of income — defined as:\n\n“any source that lawfully provides funds to or on behalf of a renter or buyer of housing, including any assistance, benefit, or subsidy program, whether such program is administered by a governmental or nongovernmental entity.”\n\nHCV utilization across the region is concentrated in the East End and Southside of Richmond, but can also be found throughout the counties, as well as the Town of Ashland. Higher HCV utilization (above 20 percent) is seen in areas near Fulton Hill, Oakwood, Manchester, and Bellwood in Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Percent of renters with Housing Choice Vouchers by tract\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Rent relief and mortgage relief\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on renters across the nation, Congress created a $25 billion Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program that was funded through the CARES Act in 2021. The program was implemented through the U.S. Treasury Department and resulted in a total of $1 billion being allocated to the Commonwealth of Virginia and eligible local governments.\nWith this funding, the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) established the Virginia Rent Relief Program (RRP), while Chesterfield County elected to administer their own rental assistance program through local nonprofit, Area Congregations Together in Service (ACTS).\nThrough DHCD, a total of 32,029 payments were made to households across Richmond, Henrico, and Hanover. Both Richmond and Henrico saw increasing households receiving rental assistance with slight dips during the early part of 2022.

    "section": "8.1 Naturally-occurring affordable housing",
    "text": "8.1 Naturally-occurring affordable housing\nNot all affordable housing is supported by public subsidy. In fact, a large share of affordable housing is privately-owned and receives no government assistance. Widely referred to as naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), or market-affordable housing, these properties are a growing concern for communities facing housing affordability challenges.\nThe preservation of NOAH properties has been a growing strategy to support affordable housing in communities as the ability to quickly develop new units has been stifled by labor shortages, rising land prices, and supply chain issues. NOAH is at great risk of being lost because it often requires greater investment to maintain and more likely to be redeveloped—in turn contributing to a loss of affordable housing units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining NOAH\n\n\n\nFor analysis purposes, we define NOAH properties as:\n\nExisting multifamily properties with active leases;\nClassified as Class B, C, or unclassified;\nNo public subsidy, rent caps, or other income-based restrictions;\nCoStar Building Rating of two or fewer stars out of five;1 and\nBuilt before 2000\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Locations\nBased on this criteria, NOAH properties are located all across the region, especially in the City of Richmond and along the borders of the city and counties, where older multifamily properties exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Map of NOAH properties in region.\n\n\n\nThe large share of NOAH is located in the City of Richmond (11,253 units or 45 percent of all NOAH units). This is no doubt due to the large amount of older multifamily properties within city limits — most of which is located in smaller buildings. Henrico County has the second largest share of NOAH in the region with 8,983 units, followed by Chesterfield County at 3,667 and Hanover County below 500 units.\nIn total, there are nearly 25,000 NOAH units across 194 properties in the region. This makes up a significant amount of rental inventory, as well as a valuable source of unsubsidized affordable housing. The aging of these properties, as well as the increasing demand for rental housing, puts significant pressure on these properties and their owners. For smaller landlords, the cost to renovate can be far too great — leading to worsening deferred maintenance and pressure to sell, which both can negatively impact renters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: NOAH units by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Building style\nCoStar places buildings into style categories based on the following definitions:\n\n\n\nStyle\nStories\nBuildings\n\n\n\n\nGarden\n1-3 Stories\n4 or more buildings\n\n\nLow-Rise\n1-3 Stories\n1-3 buildings\n\n\nMid-Rise\n4-14 Stories\n1 or more buildings\n\n\nHigh Rise\n15+ Stories\n1 or more buildings\n\n\n\nWhile not traditional multifamily properties, CoStar does track some single-family and townhome rentals that are included in this data.\nRoughly four out of five NOAH units are part of garden style properties, which are clusters of smaller one- to three-story buildings. Another 3,200 units in low-rise properties, which have similar but fewer buildings per community, round out nearly all of the NOAH supply in the region.\nHowever, garden style properties have more than 210 units on average, while low-rise properties have just 12. As a result, there more than twice as many low-rise properties (273) than garden properties (95).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: NOAH units by building style\n\n\n\n\nThe map below shows NOAH properties by building style across the region. Most of the low-rise properties are within Richmond, reflecting the early 20th century small-scale apartment buildings found across many historic neighborhoods in the city—especially the Fan and Museum District.\nGarden style properties, on the other hand, are more commonly found in the counties’ inner suburbs, and reflect development trends prevalent during those areas’ growth in the mid 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Map of NOAH properties by building style\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Age\nWith the exception of Richmond’s low-rise apartments from the 1910s to 1930s, most of the region’s NOAH units were built between 1960 and 1980. CoStar also tracks property renovations, which began for NOAH properties in the 2000s, especially closer to 2020 in Richmond and Chesterfield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantial versus minor renovations\n\n\n\nCoStar only marks a property as renovated if it:\n“…has been completely restored so that the existing space becomes ‘new’ space again. […] Minor renovations, such as the improvement of a building’s lobby or exterior are not considered full building renovations.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: NOAH properties by year built\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Rents\nNOAH properties have not been immune from the rapid rises in rent. As of Q3 2022, the average asking rent for NOAH properties was $1,173. This is about $200 less than the average asking rent across all rental properties. Although this seems like a small difference, an extra $200 a month means more money saved for childcare or transportation costs.\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic to Q3 2022, NOAH rent has increased by $104 — a 10 percent increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Average asking rent for market-affordable multifamily\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Sales\n\n\n\nThe sale of NOAH properties and ensuing new ownership often leads to rent increases and/or rehabilitation. In some cases, this may take NOAH properties out of market affordability. Over the last five years, NOAH properties have made up well over half of all multifamily property transactions in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Number of multifamily properties sold\n\n\n\n\nHowever, NOAH transactions represent a smaller share of total units sold—about one-third since 2017 Q3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: Number of multifamily units sold\n\n\n\n\nSales volume for NOAH properties has, on average, been a small fraction of total volume in the region. However, beginning in 2021 Q4, NOAH sales volume rose above $100 million for the first time since 2018 Q3, which itself was an an outlier. NOAH sales volume hit a new record in 2022 Q1 (over $178 million), stayed at that level the next quarter, and continues to be well above average to-date in 2022 Q3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Volume of multifamily sales\n\n\n\n\nDuring this timeframe, NOAH properties had an average price per unit below that of all multifamily sales until 2020 Q4. At the end of 2020, the average price per unit of a NOAH property hit a high of $221,534 — over $44,000 more when compared to all multifamily sales. Although both types of sales took a dip following the end of 2020, the higher NOAH price remained until 2021 Q2, when NOAH average price per unit once again went below all sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: Average price per unit"

    "text": "8.2 Manufactured home communities\nManufactured home communities (MHCs) are also a valuable source of NOAH across the region, but are not reliably monitors as traditional multifamily rental housing. As a result, accurate data on supply and rents are more difficult to obtain.\n\n8.2.1 Supply\nIn 2016, the Manufactured Home Community Coalition of Virginia (MHCCV) conducted an assessment of all manufactured home communities across the Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). That report found 4,735 homes across 54 MHCs in the greater region. Within the primary PHA area[^Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico, and Richmond.] there are 24 different MHCs, which in all contained at least 2,742 individual manufactured homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis data includes homes that may be rented, as well as owned. Regardless, residents in MHCs rent the lot on which their home resides. This leaves many manufactured home community residents who own their homes in a precarious position should a community owner decide to sell or redevelop the property. Manufactured homes are not easily moved once installed, leaving many families forced to abandon their homes and seek new and more expensive housing elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: Units in manufactured home communities by locality\n\n\n\n\nChesterfield County has the largest supply of homes in MHCs (1,543), which is about half the total number of subsidized rentals also in the county. Hanover and Richmond both have near 500 units in MHCs, while Henrico only has one MHC with 230 units.\n\n\n8.2.2 Locations\nThe majority of manufactured home community units are located along the Route 1 corridor. In areas where commercial and mixed-use development has accelerated, many of these properties are well-positioned for a change to a “higher and better” use. This redevelopment potential, while often in line with broader planning goals, is a threat to the long-term stability of MHCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: Units in manufactured home communities by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable changes since 2020\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, project:HOMES, acquired a 52 unit manufactured home community called Bermuda Estates in Chesterfield County. Since acquiring the community, project:HOMES has made significant infrastructure improvements, replaced some units in disrepair, and constructed a community center. The nonprofit plans to continue investments and preserve the park as a high-quality, low-cost neighborhood.\nSuburban Village, Chesterfield County’s third largest MHC with almost 250 units, was purchased by Maryland-based Horizon Land Management in August 2021 for $22.5 million. The park was previously under the same local ownership since 1986. More than 35 potential buyers expressed interest.\nShady Hill Mobile Home Park, home to more than 100 families, was purchased by a Charlottesville-based development firm for $5.1 million in August 2022. While complete redevelopment is likely, exact plans and timing are not known."

    "text": "9.1 Cost burden\nWhen incomes don’t rise along with housing costs, we can expect an increase in the number of cost-burdened households who pay more than 30 percent of their gross income on basic housing expenses. Since 2015, cost burden levels in the region decreased for some groups, while increased for others.\nData in this section come from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) dataset published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. CHAS estimates are a custom tabulation of American Community Survey responses. As of August 2022, the most recent CHAS data is for the 2014-2018 5-year period.\nUnless otherwise noted, all plots on this page combine data from Chesterfield County, Hanover County, Henrico County, and Richmond city.\n\n9.1.1 Cost burden by tenure\nThe number of cost-burdened homeowners across the region has declined significantly since 2015, particularly in Chesterfield and Henrico counties. Hanover County and Richmond city saw smaller decreases, but the total “loss” of cost-burdened homeowners in the region still exceeded 6,300.\nMeanwhile, the total number of cost-burdened renter households increased by almost 1,500, with only Hanover County seeing a small decline. Much of this growth was focused in Chesterfield County and Richmond city.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Cumulative change in cost-burdened households by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Cost burden by income\nHomeowners above 80 percent AMI saw the largest declines in cost burden since 2016. This is likely due to rising incomes among homeowners with relatively fixed housing costs. Renters with cost burdens shifted up the income spectrum, as the number of cost-burdened renters below 30 percent AMI decreased by more than 1,400, but increased more than 2,705 among those between 30 and 100 percent AMI.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Cumulative change in cost-burdened households by income and tenure\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the significant and unexpected drop among cost-burdened renters below 30 percent AMI from 2017 to 2018 deserves further explanation. Because CHAS estimates are only current through 2018, we can use more recent ACS estimates as a comparison. This data is only available by real household income values and not AMI.\nThe plot below shows the ACS estimates of renter households by cost burden from 2016 to 2020. There is a steady decline in the number of cost-burdened low-income renters (under $35,000); however, this corresponds to an increasing number of cost-burdened renters with incomes between $35,000 and $75,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Renter households by income and cost burden\n\n\n\n\nNearly all cost-burdened renter households have incomes below $75,000. Filtering for just those estimates, the plot below shows the net annual change from 2016 to 2020. The significant decrease from 2019 to 2020 (1,057) is well beyond the range from previous changes, and may also be due in part to lower ACS response rates among lower-income households during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Year-over-year change in cost-burdened renter households\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, since the total number of renter households in the region has not changed significantly from 2016 to 2020, and because the supply of deeply affordable rental housing has not increased, the estimated decline in low-income cost-burdened renters is likely due to a combination of increasing average incomes “re-sorting” households into higher income categories, as well as pandemic data collection challenges.\n\n\n9.1.3 Cost burden by household type\nSmall families and non-elderly, non-family homeowner households saw the largest decreases in cost burden across all four localities. Among renters, only small family households are now less likely to be cost-burdened, but this change (-685) is an order of magnitude smaller than the decrease for homeowner small families (-5,660).\nNet increases in cost-burden were almost entirely contained to elderly non-family and elderly family households. There are now more than 3,000 additional cost-burdened households in these groups, including both homeowners and renters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Change in cost-burdened households by household type"

    "text": "9.2 Mortgage delinquency and foreclosure\nSince the Great Recession, mortgage delinquency of 90 days or more has been on a steady decline across the region —reaching the decade’s lowest rates throughout much of 2020 and 2021. Pandemic mortgage relief measures laid out in the CARES Act led to a significant forbearance program, wherein homeowners with federally-backed mortgages could enter into forbearance for a year. The decrease in delinquency can be greatly attributed to these measures which stipulated that loans in forbearance would not be reported as delinquent.\nAccording to some researchers, this program also led to loans in delinquency prior to the pandemic entering into forbearance as well.1 Interestingly, Hanover County saw a spike in mortgage delinquency during 2018, but has since declined to the lowest rate (0.2 percent) among all localities as of December 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Mortgage delinquency rate by locality\n\n\n\n\nWith the moratorium on residential foreclosures having come to an end on June 30, 2022, the region may see increasing mortgage delinquency rates in the coming years."

    "text": "9.3 Eviction filings and judgements\nRichmond’s elevation to national prominence due to its eviction rate spurred state-level responses to address the eviction crisis across the Commonwealth. From 2017 to 2019, the region saw small declines in the number of eviction filings. The City of Richmond saw a 14 percent decrease in average annual filings, while eviction judgements only decreased by 8 percent.\n\nFor this section, we define eviction filings as the number of lawsuits generated by landlords against tenants to begin eviction proceedings. Eviction judgements are the subsequent court orders for tenants to vacate their apartment. Not every eviction case results in a judgement, and not every judgement results in a formal eviction carried out by local sheriff’s deputies.\n\nThe eviction landscape changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic when the Centers for Disease Control imposed a nationwide federal moratorium on residential evictions in September 2020. In Virginia, Governor Northam requested from the state’s Supreme Court a stay on evictions preceding the nationwide moratorium several times.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Evictions filings and judgements by locality\n\n\n\n\nThese measures led to dramatic decreases in both the number of filings and eviction judgements across the region. However, the eviction moratorium’s official end in Virginia on June 30, 2022, brings about concerns among advocates and service providers over a potential wave of evictions and homelessness in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Average annual eviction filings and orders by locality\n\n\n\n\nEviction filings should continue to be monitored over the coming months. The RVA Eviction Lab has been at the forefront of this data collection and analysis, and will continue to be a resource for the region in understanding the increasing risks for renters with renter protections and resources coming to an end."

Call volume has not dropped below 500 calls per month since March 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Housing Resource Line monthly call volume\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of calls (56 percent) were for rental options (36 percent) and financial assistance (20 percent). The two other largest share of calls were for an option not listed (17 percent) and homelessness (13 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing Resource Line volume by call topic\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, there is an increase in homelessness calls during the colder months. PHA staff note that there is an overall increase in calls during the summer months—specifically in regards to people searching for rental options.\nThis uptick in rental option calls could be directly related to lease non-renewals as landlords sought to increase rents (potentially to recoup losses from the pandemic) and the increasing demand for student rental options ahead of the fall semester."

But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the count jumped—going from 497 in 2019 to 834 in 2021, a 68 percent increase.\nThe Urban Institute recently highlighted Homeward’s (the region’s planning and coordinating organization for the GRCoC) efforts to address homelessness during the pandemic. Their response measures served as best practice examples in preventing high transmission rates among people experiencing homelessness as well as direct service staff.\nBut the challenges of reducing homelessness during the pandemic were laid bare. With an eviction moratorium, rental vacancy rates reached record lows—leaving many seeking rental options with little to none. In addition, providers have also referenced landlords setting high security deposits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Greater Richmond CoC Point-in-Time count\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5.2 Students experiencing homelessness\nThe McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) Program collects data on students experiencing homelessness, which often can paint a different picture of homelessness when compared to the Point-in-Time counts. In the region, school divisions have been seeing varying numbers, but between the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years students experiencing homelessness have declined across all school divisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining student homelessness\n\n\n\nHomeless children counted under the McKinney-Vento program are defined as “individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.” This includes children who are doubled-up with another households or living in motels, along with those living in shelters, vehicles, public areas, and other unsuitable places. This is more expansive than the definition used for PIT counts.\n\n\nThe most notable declines in student homelessness have been seen in the Richmond Public School system, where the number of students experiencing homelessness have declined by 40 percent from 2017-2018 to 2019-2020. Given the pandemic and virtual learning environments, upcoming McKinney-Vento data through the 2021-2022 school year may need require extra context.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.11: Enrolled students experiencing homelessness by school year"
