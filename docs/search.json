One potential explanation for the notable decreases in the number of three- and four-person renter households is lower ACS response rates among younger adults living with roommates during COVID-19. This population, which does not include college students living in dorms (“group quarters” are not households in Census methodology), was likely to move back home with parents during the initial phases of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Change in household size by tenure"

Families with children were the least common group of homeowners that grew.\nThe only group of renters that saw significant growth was nonfamily households. This includes both renters that live alone and those that live with non-related roommates. The estimated number of renters with children declined sharply; this may also be a symptom of lower pandemic ACS responses among lower-income working families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Change in households with children by tenure"

The data in this section comes from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), which are available only by special Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) which contain at least 100,000 people.\nWhile PUMA boundaries align with Chesterfield County, Henrico County, and Richmond city, the PUMA containing Hanover County also includes Powhatan, Goochland, New Kent, King William, Charles City counties.\n\n\nMultigenerational households are slightly more common in the core metro area (Chesterfield, Henrico, and Richmond) than the outlying suburbs. The share of multigenerational households in Chesterfield and Richmond appears to be decreasing slightly, while increasing slightly in the outer counties. The share of Henrico’s population in multigenerational households continues to sit around 8 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Percent of population living in multiple generation households"

This is more than any other arrangement. However, since 2016, the fastest growing living arrangement for young adults has been with an unmarried partner, followed by other nonrelatives (roommates). In fact, the share of young adults now living with a married spouse increased slightly more than the share still living with parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Change in 18-34 year old population by living arrangement"

    "text": "3.1 Household incomes\n\n3.1.1 Incomes by tenure\nFrom 2016 to 2020, the region saw large increases in the number of six-figure income households, particularly among homeowners (well over 25,000), but also renters (almost 6,500). This growth can likely be attributed to both new high-income residents from outside the region, as well as income growth among households already in the region.\nThere was also a minor increase in the number of middle-income renters earning between $50,000 and $100,000, reflecting continued demand for new market-rate apartments—along with affordable starter homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Change households by tenure and income level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use medians\n\n\n\nUsing medians instead of averages is a standard data analysis practice because it accounts for outliers. An average household income or home sales price would be influenced adversely by one or a few data points at the high end — causing data skewing.\n\n\nTypical homeowner incomes continue to be well above average renter incomes across the region. When adjusted for inflation, incomes across tenures for each locality show very minor to modest growth. Incomes in the city—for both homeowners and renters—remain significantly below those in the surrounding counties. The median household income for homeowners in the counties is around three times that of renters in Richmond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Median houshold income by tenure and locality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting for inflation\n\n\n\nWhen comparing dollar figures at different points in time, it is important to account for the effects of inflation on the dollar value. The value of a dollar in 2020 is not the same as in 2010 because inflation increases\nTo accurately compare data like median household incomes across time, we must convert all dollar values to the same timeframe. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to adjust previous dollar figures to the most recent data point.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Incomes by race and ethnicity\nTypical incomes in the region remain unequal by race and ethnicity. Households with the highest incomes include Asian and white, non-Hispanic residents in the counties—earning well above $75,000. Black and Hispanic households consistently have the lowest median incomes, along with multiracial households in Henrico and Richmond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Median household income by race and ethnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Incomes by family type\nHousehold incomes also vary by the presence of children or other related individuals. Throughout the region, non-family households (i.e., persons living alone or with unrelated persons) consistently have typical incomes below $50,000. In Henrico and Chesterfield counties, families living with and without children under 18 have very similar income levels. This trend is different in Hanover, where families with children have much higher incomes, as well as Richmond, where they have much lower incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Median household income by family type"

OEWS is updated annually, most recently for 2021 data. This dataset provides a rich look into wage distribution by industry and occupation.\nHowever, OEWS is only available at the national, state, and metro levels. Therefore, the data below covers the full Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) rather than the (smaller) PHA region.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Wage change by percentile\nWhile regional wages increased across the board from May 2019 to May 2021, the largest percent increases in average wages were among jobs that paid at and below the median wage. In fact, the largest growth occurred in the lowest 10th percentile of wages, due in large part to state lawmakers adopting incremental increases to Virginia’s minimum wage in 2020. The first increase from $7.25 to $9.50 per hour took effect in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nToday, state minimum wage is $11.00 per hour. Under current law, it will increase again to $12.00 in 2023. Lawmakers must reenact the measure by July 2024 to initiative further increases to $15.00 per hour by 2026.\n\n\nAnother factor in this low-end wage growth is likely the increased pay offered by many businesses, especially in the food, retail, and accommodation sectors, to encourage workers to return during the COVID-19 recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Percent change in annual wage in Richmond, VA MSA\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Wage change by occupation\nOver this same period, wages in the region grew for four of the five most common occupation categories by total employment numbers. Workers in the Transportation and Material Moving sector saw the largest increases—from an average annual salary of $30,250 to $36,370 (over 20 percent).\nJobs in Food Preparation and Serving, Sales, and Business and Financial Operations sectors—totaling more than 162,000 workers in the region as of May 2021—also saw wage growth, but less than the 13.3 percent average increase. Meanwhile, wages among Office and Administrative Support positions remained nearly the same (-0.2 percent) from 2019 to 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Percent change in annual wage for top 5 most common occupation categories"

One important disability type available in ACS data is independent living difficulty, which includes persons who:\n\nBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional problem, [have] difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping.\n\nAs a result, persons with these difficulties often face significant housing challenges as well.\n\n4.1.1 By age\nFrom 2016 to 2020, the region added almost 2,600 more persons with independent living difficulties. The largest increases occurred among young adults under 35, as well as “young” seniors between 65 and 74. The latter group will see their needs increase acutely in the next decade as they continue to age and potentially become more dependent on others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Net change in individuals with independent living difficulties by age\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 By tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe detailed estimates for persons with independent living difficulties in this and the next section are not available from the standard ACS tables published by the Census Bureau.

Most are in homes that they own, or in homes owned by another occupant, such as a spouse. This is not the case in Richmond, however, where about half live in rented homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Percent of persons with independent living difficulties by household tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 By household size\nPersons with independent living difficulties are most likely to live with one other person in their home. Slightly larger households (3 to 4 persons total) are also common. Still, more than 15 percent live alone—including nearly one-in-four in Richmond.

From 2016 to 2020, owner-occupied housing has increased by 17,436—an increase of seven percent. Unsurprisingly, much of that growth (93 percent) has occurred in the single-family home market, including detached and attached homes. The largest share of that single-family home growth has occurred in Chesterfield County, where there was a net gain of 7,184 single-family owner-occupied homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Change in owner-occupied housing units by structure type\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Age of stock\nBetween 2016 and 2020, almost all additions to the homeowner-occupied housing stock in the region were, intuitively, homes built in the past decade. However, there have also been thousands of net additions among homes built before 1940 and between 1980 and 2009. These homes were most likely previously occupied by renters and have now been reconverted into homeownership opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Change in owner-occupied housing units by year built\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Bedrooms\nThe majority of new owner-occupied homes in the region have three or more bedrooms, continuing design and size trends prevalent since the mid 20th century. At the same time, homeowner households have become smaller, which creates a surplus of largely unused bedrooms across the market.\nSmaller housing options exist largely in the City of Richmond or Henrico County. While single-family homes—or condo units—with one- or two- bedrooms are usually much more affordable, these housing options are often in older, but highly desirable neighborhoods in the City of Richmond (i.e., The Fan and Church Hill).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Change in owner-occupied housing units by number of bedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Production\nAll localities in the region experienced single-family construction declines as a result of the Great Recession from late 2007 to early 2012 — especially Chesterfield and Henrico. Recovery has been unevenly distributed, however.\nFrom 2010 onward, every locality has seen increasing single-family home construction, but the steepest increase has been in Chesterfield County. From 2010 to 2020, single-family home construction has gone from 545 units to 2,202 per year in a decade — a 300% increase. Although Chesterfield County was on its way to pre-Recession levels, all other localities are seeing slow growth in the single-family home construction space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Single-family building permits"

This accounts for the net increase in homeowners (over 15,000) and relatively steady number of renters over this time period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Homeownership rate by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 By age\nDespite high rents, high debt, and low inventory, younger households (under 35) have made some progress toward homeownership since 2016. Their homeownership rate across the region increased from 30 to 35 percent. On the other hand, homeownership rates for middle-age and older households remained about the same from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Homeownership rate by age group\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 By race and ethnicity\nAcross the region, the homeownership gap remains wide between white households and households of color. White households in the Richmond area are the only group with a homeownership rate above 70 percent. However, several other groups—including Asian, multiracial, and Black households—have seen slight increases in their homeownership rates since 2016. At the same time, homeownership rates have fallen slightly for Hispanic or Latino households and those of another race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Homeownership rate by race and ethnicity"

All localities saw reductions in typical sales volumes during early parts of the pandemic (spring to early summer 2020)—no doubt a result of stay-at-home orders. But by 2021, sales volume began to climb back as historically low interest rates incentivized home buying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Monthly home sales by locality\n\n\n\nChesterfield County continued to lead the region in home sales—hitting a monthly peak in June 2021, with a total of 809 sales. In nearly all localities except for Chesterfield County, the average monthly home sales has largely remained the same. Only in Chesterfield County was there a more than 10 percent increase in average monthly home sales between 2019 and 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Average monthly home sales by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Sales price\nMedian home prices have continued to climb in the Richmond Region—reaching over $300,000 in all four major localities. The greatest price increases have occurred in the City of Richmond during 2022, where the median home price went from $303,941 in February to $389,950 in June, a 28 percent increase. Home prices continue to remain high in spite of rising mortgage interest rates.\nHanover County remains the most expensive locality in the region with a median home price of $423,250 as of September 2022, followed by the Chesterfield County ($371,273), Henrico County ($349,950), and the City of Richmond ($325,500).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Monthly median sales price by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Supply\nThe inventory of for-sale housing before the pandemic typically sat at two months or more—meaning that it would take two or more months to sell at current prices. A healthy level of supply has said to be five or six months worth, but in recent years the region has been below that, which indicates a strong seller’s market.\nWhen pandemic began in March 2020, months supply dropped to two months and then by June 2020 hit a low of one month and has sat squarely there ever since. Even amid rising interest rates in 2022 and talks of a housing slump, months supply continues to remain low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Months of supply\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Starter homes\nStarter homes provide young adults the ability to get on the first rung of the homeownership ladder. This allows many young adults the ability to build equity before their household grows (i.e. marriage and children). But starter homes are becoming more and more scarce. This has largely been the result of starter home opportunities not coming to market. In some cases, older homes occupied by seniors are not hitting the market because senior desire to age-in-place remains high or seniors simply cannot find other affordable options themselves. Starter homes are also ripe for investor flipping, which leaves first-time homebuyers competing with all cash offers.\nIn addition, smaller homes do not make up a significant share of new construction stock. Smaller homes (two-bedroom or less) are often more desirable among seniors and young adults without children. The lack of this stock prevents the movement of households from different rungs along the homeownership ladder — locking homeowners into homes that often no longer work for them.\nIn 2021, the Virginia REALTORS® (VAR) conducted an analysis of the number and share of starter homes sold in Virginia from 2013 to mid-2021. This analysis was included in the statewide housing study conducted by HousingForward Virginia as part of HB 854. To calculate the number and share of starter homes sold, VAR calculated the number of homes sold that would be affordable to a household making 80 percent of AMI.\nFor the region, the share of starter homes sold has been in a steady decline. The greatest decrease has occurred in Chesterfield County, where the share of starter homes sold has gone from 63 percent to 46 percent. The smallest decrease occurred in Henrico County, a decrease of only 8 percentage points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Share of sold homes affordable to 80% AMI"

    "text": "5.4 New construction versus resale\n\n5.4.1 Sales price\nThe affordability of resale homes compared to new construction has often made them the first rung on the homeownership ladder. But since the start of the pandemic, the median resale home price has risen above the $300,000 mark and in June 2022 reached a high of $371,250.\nDuring this timeframe, new construction median home prices have remained above $350,000 and throughout 2022 so far have stayed above $400,000. On average, there is a $89,127 difference between new construction and resale sales price—leaving new construction significantly out of reach for lower income households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Median price of new construction and resale\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Bedrooms\nThe majority of home sales in the region have been for three- and four-bedroom homes — roughly three in four homes sold in the past five years. Nuances exist at either end of the bedroom spectrum.\nNew construction with one- to two-bedrooms has been increasing — going from six percent of sales in 2017 to nine percent in 2022 YTD. At the other end, new construction of five or more bedroom homes has increased as well with an increase of three percent (15 percent of sales in 2017 to 18 percent in 2022 YTD). For resale homes, the share of homes by bedroom has remained largely unchanged each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Share of bedrooms by new construction and resales\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Size\nIn the past five years, there have been clear differences in new construction and resale sales by square footage. The majority of resale homes have been under 2,000 square feet, while new construction is overwhelmingly over 2,000 square feet. These differences have clear implications on home prices (i.e. more square footage means higher prices). But across the region, minimum requirements set out by localities in zoning ordinances impact these builder decisions.\nBuilding smaller homes is less profitable given the rising cost to develop a single detached home (e.g. rising land, infrastructure, and regulatory costs). In order to maximize profit, home builders need to increase square footage to recoup costs and meet development requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.15: Home size by new construction and resales"

    "text": "6.1 Supply\n\n6.1.1 Change in stock\nWhile many renters across the region do live in multifamily buildings (with 5 or more units), the second largest share of rental housing is single-family housing (either attached or detached). In 2020, over a third (37 percent) of rental housing in the region consisted of single-family housing, while 49 percent was located in buildings with 5 or more units. There has been little change in these percentages since 2016.\nChanges in the shares of rental housing have been small — but those changes have been among rental housing with 20 or more units (17 percent in 2016 to 19 percent in 2020) and 2 to 4 unit buildings (14 percent in 2016 down to 13 percent in 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Change in share of renter-occupied housing units by structure type\n\n\n\nThe raw changes in rental housing were most felt in Henrico County and the City of Richmond. In Henrico, there was a 1,930 increase in single-family rental housing and a 1,357 decrease in 2 to 4 unit rental housing (i.e. duplexes, triplexes, and quads).\nThe City of Richmond saw a contrasting decrease in single-family rentals (-1,921), while also experiencing a 2,134 increase in rental housing located in buildings with 20 or more units. Chesterfield County has seen slight increases in multifamily housing of all types, while Hanover County has not seen much change at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Change in renter-occupied housing units by structure type\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Age of stock\nSince 2016, the region has seen major changes in the age of its rental stock as existing homes transition from being owned to leased out, or vice-versa. Of note, every locality except for Hanover saw significant increases in the number of renter-occupied homes built between 1980 and 1999.\nThese homes—now over 20 years old—are likely becoming the target of investors purchasing from homeowners, making certain improvements, and renting them out. In Henrico County, this trend was even more prevalent among homes built between 1960 and 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Value Analysis (MVA)\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Richmond Memorial Health Foundation (RMHF) and PlanRVA commissioned a second Market Value Analysis (MVA) of the Richmond region. The MVA is a “is a data-based, field-validated analysis and mapping of a community’s housing market.” Richmond’s MVA provides fine-grained data analysis of neighborhood changes and trends, including residential vacancy and investor sales.\nLearn more about the MVA here.\n\n\nConversely, Chesterfield and Henrico each had over 1,000 homes built between 2000 and 2009 change from renter- to owner-occupied. The largest losses in rental stock, however, occurred in Richmond among homes built prior to 1980. Several factors could explain this decline:\n\nActual demolition of very old, low-quality homes,\nDuplexes and triplexes converted into single-family homes, and\nSingle-family rentals purchased by buyers who now live in the home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Change in renter-occupied housing units by year built\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Bedrooms\nRental homes in the Richmond region are most likely to have one or two bedrooms. While the number of one-bedroom apartments has continued to increase (+1,617) from 2016, the number of two-bedroom units has decreased by 2,500.\nThe increasing supply of one-bedroom apartments coincides with a similar increase in studio apartments—these unit sizes reflect new apartments, largely in Richmond, marketed for college students and other young adults.\nThe dwindling number of two-bedroom rental homes may reflect small single-family rentals in older neighborhoods transitioning to owner-occupancy, as there is a similar (but much less significant) decline in three-bedroom units.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Change in renter-occupied housing units by number of bedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Production\nConstruction of multifamily properties (with 5 units or more) has been sporadic since the end of the Great Recession. In all localities aside from Hanover County, there have been waves and dips in the multifamily building construction. Hanover has seen little to no activity throughout the last two decades, while Chesterfield County and Richmond have seen the bulk of activity.\nDuring the latter half of the last decade, Chesterfield County had a boom in multifamily construction — nearing 1,500 units in 2019. Meanwhile, Richmond’s multifamily construction saw dips following the Great Recession and again in 2018, but has largely been up in the last couple years of the 2010s. Although Henrico County had dips in 2016 and 2018, multifamily construction has more often than not been above the 700 unit mark."

    "text": "6.2 Rental market\n\n6.2.1 Average market asking rent\nRental demand reached a fever pitch amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With eviction moratoriums and a flow of rental assistance, low supply gave way to historic rent increases. The average market asking rent in the region reached a two-decade high of $1,395 in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Average asking rent\n\n\n\nLarge quarterly increases in average rents began in early 2021 and have continued to the present. From the first to second quarters of this year, rents increased by $31. However, this relative growth was very near the change in inflation over that same period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Quarterly change in average asking rent\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Rents by submarket\nAlthough not adjusted for inflation, rents by submarket show that there are distinct average rents across the region. Since 2010, the steepest increases have occurred in the counties. Northside Richmond remains the least expensive submarket with an average rent of $1,037 in the second quarter of this year, while Midlothian is the most expensive at $1,655.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Average asking rent by submarket\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Rents by bedrooms\nRents in the region have risen the most among three-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, reflecting continued demand for units that have actually declined in supply since 2016. In contrast, average rents for studio and one-bedroom apartments—which grew by more than 2,700 units since 2016—have increased less than $100 over the last decade when adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Average asking rent by bedroom\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Rents by age of units\nRecently constructed rental housing (built in 2010 and after) leads average asking rents at $1,614. As expected, rental costs correlate to the period in which they were built — with older rental housing being less expensive. Pre-1980 rental housing is roughly $400 cheaper than more recent rental housing.\nIn the last decade, more recent rental housing had steady and modest increases; only increasing $80 from Q1 2012 to Q2 2022. But older rental housing had much more dramatic increases; increasing an average of $257 in that same time period.\nRental housing built between 1980 and 2009 had especially steep increases during the height of the pandemic (Q1 2020 to Q3 2021). In this time, the average asking rent increased by over $130, while rent increases for newer rental housing and pre-1980 housing increased by less than $100.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Average asking rent by age of unit"

    "text": "7.1 Affordable rental housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of federal housing assistance programs help low-income residents across the region with rental housing opportunities. Today, there are approximately 25,969 dedicated affordable rental homes found across 240 properties in the Richmond area. These include units both currently occupied and in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding sources\n\n\n\nIn the Richmond region, many affordable rental properties also receive assistance from the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, as well as local sources such as CDBG and HOME grants. The City of Richmond also awards funding to affordable rental projects with its own trust fund. These awards often fill a financing “gap” and do not provide a majority of the total assistance for a development; as a result, they are not specifically reflected in the data.\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Subsidy types\nOver half (51 percent) of all affordable rental homes in the region rely solely on the LIHTC program. Another 31 percent have layered multiple subsidies together, reflecting the capital and funding requirements needed to develop new affordable housing.\nThe other significant source of dedicated affordable housing continues to be more than 3,600 Public Housing units managed by Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDescriptions of each rental assistance program are available on the NHPD website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that Section 8 described in this section is not the same as Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. Section 8 subsidies described in this section refer to HUD project-based rental assistance — meaning that they are rental assistance that is tied to a specific development, whereas Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are tenant-based subsidies that a recipient can take wherever they can find housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Share of federally assisted units by subsidy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Layered subsidies\nIn an effort to maximize assistance, rental subsidy programs are often layered together into single projects. Among the 8,061 units with multiple subsidies, over half have either a 4% or 9% LIHTC tax credit—or both “twinned” together. Section 8 Housing Finance and Development Agency (HFDA) New Construction and Loan Management Set-Aside (LMSA) programs are also common types.\n“Other” subsidies generally include HUD insurance programs and other, less common, Section 8 programs. Still, these minor assistance packages nevertheless provide helping subsidy to almost three-in-four units with multiple affordability contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1:  Active subsidies in units with mutiple subsidies \n \n  \n    Detailed subsidy type \n    Units with subsidy \n    Percent of total \n  \n \n\n  \n    LIHTC 4% Tax Credit \n    4,747 \n    58.9% \n  \n  \n    LIHTC 9% Tax Credit \n    4,371 \n    54.2% \n  \n  \n    Section 8 HFDA/8 NC \n    1,584 \n    19.7% \n  \n  \n    Section 8 LMSA \n    1,173 \n    14.6% \n  \n  \n    Other \n    5,880 \n    72.9% \n  \n\n\n Sources: National Housing Preservation Database and Virginia Housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTable totals do not add to 100 percent because units are percent of all 8,061 units with multiple subsidies, not the total of all subsidies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Locations\nThe map below shows the locations of affordable rental properties in the Richmond region. Each color corresponds to the property’s subsidy as recorded in the National Housing Preservation Database, or if multiple subsidies are currently active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Federally-assisted rental housing properties\n\n\n\nRichmond continues to support the majority of affordable rentals in the region (about 60 percent—more than 15,200). While Chesterfield and Henrico counties both have similar amounts of LIHTC-only units, Henrico has nearly 2,900 additional units supported by multiple subsidies—generally combinations of LIHTC and a Section 8 program.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Federally assisted units by subsidy and locality\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Changes since 2020\nSince January 2020, the region has seen 57 new rental subsidies added, which increased the number of active affordability contracts on units by 4,393. Over that same period, 17 subsidies ended, affecting 1,633 units. Some properties had multiple subsidies either added or expired. In all, there was a net addition of 2,760 rental affordability contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.2:  Added and removed affordable rental contracts since 2020 \n \n  \n     \n    Subsidies \n    Properties affected \n    Units included \n  \n \n\n  \n    Added \n    57 \n    53 \n    4,393 \n  \n  \n    Removed \n    -17 \n    -16 \n    -1,633 \n  \n  \n    Net change \n    40 \n    37 \n    2,760 \n  \n\n\n Sources: National Housing Preservation Database and Virginia Housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew LIHTC units (net 2,129) comprised the majority of added affordable rentals, followed by Section 8 contracts (net 1,132). Net losses of affordable rental contracts occurred in projects supported by HOME funding and HUD insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Additions and removals of subsidized rental units\n\n\n\nWhile LIHTC additions drove new affordable supply in Richmond and Chesterfield, new (or renewed) Section 8 contracts covered more than 400 units in Henrico. Over 500 units in Richmond and Henrico saw HUD insurance contracts expire; however, many of these are in projects with another form of rental assistance that has not expired.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Net change in subsidized rental unit contracts by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.5 LIHTC preservation\nLIHTC properties have a 30 year commitment to affordability, but only a 15 year compliance period, wherein property owners can increase rents. Nonprofit developers will often seek new allocation of tax credits before their commitment period ends, but there is often little incentive for for-profit developers to maintain affordability restrictions past the compliance period.\nBy 2040, a large portion of active LIHTC units will be outside the 30 year commitment period — even far more will be outside the 15 year compliance period. Just over 13,000 LIHTC units will be beyond the 30 year commitment period by 2040, which accounts for well over half of all active LIHTC units as of early 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Percent of active LIHTC units by end of commitment period\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.6 Public Housing\nThe redevelopment of public housing in the City of Richmond has begun to take shape at the first of the “Big Six” public housing courts — Creighton Court. This public housing property located in Richmond’s far East End consisted of 504 public housing units.\nAs part of their first phase of redevelopment, RRHA has begun demolition of Creighton Court, with plans to develop roughly 700 units of mixed-income housing. Construction on Phase 1 is expected to begin in Winter 2022 with the entire redevelopment process expected to last ten years.\nRRHA’s next focus area will be Gilpin Court, north of Jackson Ward, where about 780 public housing units reside. In November 2021, RRHA and the City of Richmond were awarded a Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for $450,000.\nThis planning grant is being utilized to facilitate the community planning process around not only Gilpin Court, but the Jackson Ward community — including strategies to undo the negative impacts of interstate development on the historically Black communities of Jackson Ward and North Jackson Ward.\n\nNet change in units for public housing redevelopment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic housing community\nOriginal units\nReplacement units\nNet change\n\n\n\n\nCreighton Court\n504\n700\n+196\n\n\nGilpin Court\n780\nTBD\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding for Public Housing redevelopment\n\n\n\nFederal housing policy has guided public housing authorities to use newer funding streams to redevelop older public housing communities.

This provides household with greater choice in where they want to live, but historically many HCV recipients have faced discrimination from landlords unwilling to accept HCV.\nThis changed significantly in early 2020, when the Virginia General Assembly passed new fair housing legislation that made it illegal to discriminate based on source of income — defined as:\n\n“any source that lawfully provides funds to or on behalf of a renter or buyer of housing, including any assistance, benefit, or subsidy program, whether such program is administered by a governmental or nongovernmental entity.”\n\nHCV utilization across the region is concentrated in the East End and Southside of Richmond, but can also be found throughout the counties, as well as the Town of Ashland. Higher HCV utilization (above 20 percent) is seen in areas near Fulton Hill, Oakwood, Manchester, and Bellwood in Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Percent of renters with Housing Choice Vouchers by tract\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Rent relief and mortgage relief\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on renters across the nation, Congress created a $25 billion Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program that was funded through the CARES Act in 2021. The program was implemented through the U.S. Treasury Department and resulted in a total of $1 billion being allocated to the Commonwealth of Virginia and eligible local governments.\nWith this funding, the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) established the Virginia Rent Relief Program (RRP), while Chesterfield County elected to administer their own rental assistance program through local nonprofit, Area Congregations Together in Service (ACTS).\nThrough DHCD, a total of 32,029 payments were made to households across Richmond, Henrico, and Hanover. Both Richmond and Henrico saw increasing households receiving rental assistance with slight dips during the early part of 2022. Few households in Hanover County sought rental relief from DHCD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll data not available\n\n\n\nChesterfield County rent relief data has not been received yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: Rent relief payments by locality\n\n\n\nAverage payments per household across the three localities was well above $4,000 for most of the program’s duration, with the highest payments being made in Hanover County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Average assistance by month and locality"

    "section": "8.1 Naturally-occurring affordable housing",
    "text": "8.1 Naturally-occurring affordable housing\nNot all affordable housing is supported by public subsidy. In fact, a large share of affordable housing is privately-owned and receives no government assistance. Widely referred to as naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), or market-affordable housing, these properties are a growing concern for communities facing housing affordability challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it really “naturally-occurring”?\n\n\n\nMany experts consider NOAH to be a misnomer because there is nothing “natural” about the affordability of these properties. Some prefer “market-rate affordable”. But regardless of the choice of term, this type of housing plays a pivotal, albeit precarious, role in providing localities with a significant amount of affordable housing without government resources.\n\n\nThe preservation of NOAH properties has been a growing strategy to support affordable housing in communities as the ability to quickly develop new units has been stifled by labor shortages, rising land prices, and supply chain issues. NOAH is at great risk of being lost because it often requires greater investment to maintain and more likely to be redeveloped—in turn contributing to a loss of affordable housing units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining NOAH\n\n\n\nFor analysis purposes, we define NOAH properties as:\n\nExisting multifamily properties with active leases;\nClassified as Class B, C, or unclassified;\nNo public subsidy, rent caps, or other income-based restrictions;\nCoStar Building Rating of two or fewer stars out of five;1 and\nBuilt before 2000\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Locations\nBased on this criteria, NOAH properties are located all across the region, especially in the City of Richmond and along the borders of the city and counties, where older multifamily properties exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: NOAH properties in Richmond region\n\n\n\nThe large share of NOAH is located in the City of Richmond (11,253 units or 45 percent of all NOAH units). This is no doubt due to the large amount of older multifamily properties within city limits — most of which is located in smaller buildings. Henrico County has the second largest share of NOAH in the region with 8,983 units, followed by Chesterfield County at 3,667 and Hanover County below 500 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider that the City of Richmond contains much of the region’s older housing stock. This includes many older apartment buildings that are anywhere from two to twenty units in size. While they may fall under the NOAH classification set out in this analysis, their rents may actually be higher due to the overwhelming demand for rental housing among young professionals and students in the city.\nComparably cheaper than new multifamily properties that offer amenities such as pools and fitness centers, these properties are still able to command such high rents due to their proximity to Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Union University, as well as other urban amenities like restaurants, bars, and retail.\n\n\nIn total, there are nearly 25,000 NOAH units across 194 properties in the region. This makes up a significant amount of rental inventory, as well as a valuable source of unsubsidized affordable housing. The aging of these properties, as well as the increasing demand for rental housing, puts significant pressure on these properties and their owners. For smaller landlords, the cost to renovate can be far too great — leading to worsening deferred maintenance and pressure to sell, which both can negatively impact renters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: NOAH units by locality\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Building style\nCoStar places buildings into style categories based on the following definitions:\n\n\n\nStyle\nStories\nBuildings\n\n\n\n\nGarden\n1-3 Stories\n4 or more buildings\n\n\nLow-Rise\n1-3 Stories\n1-3 buildings\n\n\nMid-Rise\n4-14 Stories\n1 or more buildings\n\n\nHigh Rise\n15+ Stories\n1 or more buildings\n\n\n\nWhile not traditional multifamily properties, CoStar does track some single-family and townhome rentals that are included in this data.\nRoughly four out of five NOAH units are part of garden style properties, which are clusters of smaller one- to three-story buildings. Another 3,200 units in low-rise properties, which have similar but fewer buildings per community, round out nearly all of the NOAH supply in the region.\nHowever, garden style properties have more than 210 units on average, while low-rise properties have just 12. As a result, there more than twice as many low-rise properties (273) than garden properties (95).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnitsProperties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: NOAH units by building style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: NOAH properties by building style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map below shows NOAH properties by building style across the region. Most of the low-rise properties are within Richmond, reflecting the early 20th century small-scale apartment buildings found across many historic neighborhoods in the city—especially the Fan and Museum District.\nGarden style properties, on the other hand, are more commonly found in the counties’ inner suburbs, and reflect development trends prevalent during those areas’ growth in the mid 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: NOAH properties by building style\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Age\nWith the exception of Richmond’s low-rise apartments from the 1910s to 1930s, most of the region’s NOAH units were built between 1960 and 1980. CoStar also tracks property renovations, which began for NOAH properties in the 2000s, especially closer to 2020 in Richmond and Chesterfield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantial versus minor renovations\n\n\n\nCoStar only marks a property as renovated if it:\n“…has been completely restored so that the existing space becomes ‘new’ space again. […] Minor renovations, such as the improvement of a building’s lobby or exterior are not considered full building renovations.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: NOAH properties by year built\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Rents\nNOAH properties have not been immune from the rapid rises in rent. As of Q3 2022, the average asking rent for NOAH properties was $1,173. This is about $200 less than the average asking rent across all rental properties. Although this seems like a small difference, an extra $200 a month means more money saved for childcare or transportation costs.\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic to Q3 2022, NOAH rent has increased by $104 — a 10 percent increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Average asking rent for market-affordable multifamily\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Sales\n\n\n\nThe sale of NOAH properties and ensuing new ownership often leads to rent increases and/or rehabilitation. In some cases, this may take NOAH properties out of market affordability. Over the last five years, NOAH properties have made up well over half of all multifamily property transactions in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: Number of multifamily properties sold\n\n\n\nHowever, NOAH transactions represent a smaller share of total units sold—about one-third since 2017 Q3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Number of multifamily units sold\n\n\n\nSales volume for NOAH properties has, on average, been a small fraction of total volume in the region. However, beginning in 2021 Q4, NOAH sales volume rose above $100 million for the first time since 2018 Q3, which itself was an an outlier. NOAH sales volume hit a new record in 2022 Q1 (over $178 million), stayed at that level the next quarter, and continues to be well above average to-date in 2022 Q3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: Volume of multifamily sales\n\n\n\nDuring this timeframe, NOAH properties had an average price per unit below that of all multifamily sales until 2020 Q4. At the end of 2020, the average price per unit of a NOAH property hit a high of $221,534 — over $44,000 more when compared to all multifamily sales. Although both types of sales took a dip following the end of 2020, the higher NOAH price remained until 2021 Q2, when NOAH average price per unit once again went below all sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: Average price per unit"

    "text": "8.2 Manufactured home communities\nManufactured home communities (MHCs) are also a valuable source of NOAH across the region, but are not reliably monitors as traditional multifamily rental housing. As a result, accurate data on supply and rents are more difficult to obtain.\n\n8.2.1 Supply\nIn 2016, the Manufactured Home Community Coalition of Virginia (MHCCV) conducted an assessment of all manufactured home communities across the Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). That report found 4,735 homes across 54 MHCs in the greater region. Within the primary PHA area2 there are 24 different MHCs, which in all contained at least 2,742 individual manufactured homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis data includes homes that may be rented, as well as owned. Regardless, residents in MHCs rent the lot on which their home resides. This leaves many manufactured home community residents who own their homes in a precarious position should a community owner decide to sell or redevelop the property. Manufactured homes are not easily moved once installed, leaving many families forced to abandon their homes and seek new and more expensive housing elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: Units in manufactured home communities by locality\n\n\n\nChesterfield County has the largest supply of homes in MHCs (1,543), which is about half the total number of subsidized rentals also in the county. Hanover and Richmond both have near 500 units in MHCs, while Henrico only has one MHC with 230 units.\n\n\n8.2.2 Locations\nThe majority of manufactured home community units are located along the Route 1 corridor. In areas where commercial and mixed-use development has accelerated, many of these properties are well-positioned for a change to a “higher and better” use. This redevelopment potential, while often in line with broader planning goals, is a threat to the long-term stability of MHCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.13: Manufactured housing communities in Richmond region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable changes since 2020\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, project:HOMES, acquired a 52 unit manufactured home community called Bermuda Estates in Chesterfield County. Since acquiring the community, project:HOMES has made significant infrastructure improvements, replaced some units in disrepair, and constructed a community center. The nonprofit plans to continue investments and preserve the park as a high-quality, low-cost neighborhood.\nSuburban Village, Chesterfield County’s third largest MHC with almost 250 units, was purchased by Maryland-based Horizon Land Management in August 2021 for $22.5 million. The park was previously under the same local ownership since 1986. More than 35 potential buyers expressed interest.\nShady Hill Mobile Home Park, home to more than 100 families, was purchased by a Charlottesville-based development firm for $5.1 million in August 2022. While complete redevelopment is likely, exact plans and timing are not known."

For renters making less than 80% AMI across the region, there has been little change in the gap in affordable rental housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Rental housing gap by AMI\n\n\n\nIn 2015, there was an overall gap of 38,778 rental homes affordable to households making 80% AMI or less. By 2019, that gap had increased by 1,220 homes to reach a total gap of 38,778.\nIncreases in the gap occurred mainly among housing at 30 percent AMI and below, but it is important to note that a gap in housing across all income levels impacts households of any income. This accentuates the need for new affordable housing at all income levels — but especially for 30% AMI or below households. As of 2018, these extremely low-income renters face a shortage of over 24,000 rental homes."

Every locality say home prices rise more than 50 percent, with average rents not far behind. Average renter incomes also increased from 2016 to 2020, although those gains were not as steady across all localities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Cumulative percent change in median renter income, home prices, and average rent\n\n\n\nHowever, there are two other important takeaways:\n\nAverage renter income data is currently only available through 2020, while the sharpest housing price increases occurred from then through 2022.\nAverage renter incomes were already below the level necessary to afford the typical apartment or home for sale.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Rental affordability\nMarket asking rents across the region have been on the incline between 2016. Still, the median incomes for renters in Chesterfield and Henrico—at least from 2016 to 2020—could afford average rents. That was not the case for Henrico and Richmond, where the monthly rental price affordability gaps were $20 and $218, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating rental affordability\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, an “affordable rent” is no more than 30 percent of a household’s gross monthly income. Any rent amount higher than this level would make the renter cost-burdened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Average rents versus affordable rents for median renter income\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Homeownership affordability\nTo determine how affordable homeownership is at the median renter income, we can calculate the maximum home sales price affordable to a buyer with that income. To make these estimates, we make the following simplified assumptions:\n\n5 percent down payment\n1.5 percent in closing costs\n$250 per month for property taxes\n$150 per month for insurance and other costs\n\nFor underwriting purposes, we assume that the monthly mortgage payment plus these costs can not exceed 28 percent of the buyer’s gross income. For example, a renter earning $50,000 can afford a monthly housing cost no more than $1,166.67.\nTo determine the maximum principal amount, and the subsequent sales price, we assume a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage using the average annual interest rates published by Freddie Mac1. The 2022 value is the average through August. The figure below shows these interest rates used for the homeowner affordability analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Average annual rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages\n\n\n\nThe figure below shows these maximum affordable home sales prices versus actual median sales prices for each locality from 2016 through 2020. Only median sales prices are shown for 2021 and 2022 year-to-date, since renter income estimates from ACS are only available through 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Median sales price versus maximum home price affordable to median renter income\n\n\n\nIn the three counties, median sales prices were generally just out of reach for the average renter’s income from 2016 through 2019. Then, historically low interest rates in 2020 increased buyers’ purchasing power to put the median-priced home within reach.\nThe purchase price gap in Richmond, however, has continued—even with lower rates, the average renter could not afford to buy a home more than $200,000 in 2020. By 2021, the median-priced home in the city topped $300,000 for the first time."

These wages are an opportunity to assess the ability of many of the region’s workers to afford rent or purchase a home. Annual salary amounts range from $75,800 for workers in Business and Financial Operations, to $23,650 for those in Food Preparation and Serving Related positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Median annual salaries for the five most common occupation categories\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1 Rental affordability\nEvery occupation except for Business and Financial Operations supports an affordable rent less than $1,000.

    "text": "10.1 Cost burden\nWhen incomes don’t rise along with housing costs, we can expect an increase in the number of cost-burdened households who pay more than 30 percent of their gross income on basic housing expenses. Since 2015, cost burden levels in the region decreased for some groups, while increased for others.\nData in this section come from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) dataset published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. CHAS estimates are a custom tabulation of American Community Survey responses. As of October 2022, the most recent CHAS data is for the 2015-2019 5-year period.\nUnless otherwise noted, all plots on this page combine data from Chesterfield County, Hanover County, Henrico County, and Richmond city.\n\n10.1.1 Cost burden by tenure\nThe number of cost-burdened homeowners across the region has declined significantly since 2015, particularly in Chesterfield and Henrico counties. Hanover County and Richmond city saw smaller decreases, but the total “loss” of cost-burdened homeowners in the region still exceeded 7,200.\nMeanwhile, the total number of cost-burdened renter households increased by almost 1,900, with only Hanover County seeing a small decline. Much of this growth in renter cost burden was focused in Chesterfield County and Richmond city.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Cumulative change in cost-burdened households by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Cost burden by income\nHomeowners above 80 percent AMI saw the largest declines in cost burden since 2015. This is likely due to rising incomes among homeowners with relatively fixed housing costs. Although renters with higher incomes were seeing growing cost burden from 2015 to 2018, 2019 estimates show an abrupt shift in trends. Renters making less than 50 percent AMI saw an increase in cost burden from 2015 of nearly 4,000 households. The number of households making greater than 50 percent AMI saw an overall decrease in cost burden from 2015 estimates — reversing the increases seen in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Cumulative change in cost-burdened households by income and tenure\n\n\n\nHowever, the significant and unexpected drop among cost-burdened renters below 30 percent AMI from 2017 to 2018 deserves further explanation. The increase in 2019 appears to be more aligned with our sense of the rental housing market over the past few years.\nThe plot below shows the ACS estimates of renter households by cost burden from 2016 to 2020. There is a steady decline in the number of cost-burdened low-income renters (under $35,000); however, this corresponds to an increasing number of cost-burdened renters with incomes between $35,000 and $75,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Renter households by income and cost burden\n\n\n\nNearly all cost-burdened renter households have incomes below $75,000. Filtering for just those estimates, the plot below shows the net annual change from 2016 to 2020. The significant decrease from 2019 to 2020 (1,057) is well beyond the range from previous changes, and may also be due in part to lower ACS response rates among lower-income households during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Year-over-year change in cost-burdened renter households\n\n\n\nIn summary, since the total number of renter households in the region has not changed significantly from 2016 to 2020, and because the supply of deeply affordable rental housing has not increased, the estimated decline in low-income cost-burdened renters is likely due to a combination of increasing average incomes “re-sorting” households into higher income categories, as well as pandemic data collection challenges.\n\n\n10.1.3 Cost burden by household type\nSmall families and non-elderly, non-family homeowner households saw the largest decreases in cost burden across all four localities. Among renters, only small family households are now less likely to be cost-burdened, but this change (-765) is an order of magnitude smaller than the decrease for homeowner small families (-6,525).\nNet increases in cost-burden were almost entirely contained to elderly non-family and elderly family households. There are now more than 4,600 additional cost-burdened households in these groups, including both homeowners and renters.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Change in cost-burdened households by household type"

Pandemic mortgage relief measures laid out in the CARES Act led to a significant forbearance program, wherein homeowners with federally-backed mortgages could enter into forbearance for a year. The decrease in delinquency can be greatly attributed to these measures which stipulated that loans in forbearance would not be reported as delinquent.\nAccording to some researchers, this program also led to loans in delinquency prior to the pandemic entering into forbearance as well.1 Interestingly, Hanover County saw a spike in mortgage delinquency during 2018, but has since declined to the lowest rate (0.2 percent) among all localities as of December 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Mortgage delinquency rate by locality\n\n\n\nWith the moratorium on residential foreclosures having come to an end on June 30, 2022, the region may see increasing mortgage delinquency rates in the coming years."

From 2017 to 2019, the region saw small declines in the number of eviction filings. The City of Richmond saw a 14 percent decrease in average annual filings, while eviction judgements only decreased by 8 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining evictions\n\n\n\nFor this section, we define eviction filings as the number of lawsuits generated by landlords against tenants to begin eviction proceedings. Eviction judgements are the subsequent court orders for tenants to vacate their apartment. Not every eviction case results in a judgement, and not every judgement results in a formal eviction carried out by local sheriff’s deputies.\n\n\nThe eviction landscape changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic when the Centers for Disease Control imposed a nationwide federal moratorium on residential evictions in September 2020. In Virginia, Governor Northam requested from the state’s Supreme Court a stay on evictions preceding the nationwide moratorium several times.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Evictions filings and judgements by locality\n\n\n\nThese measures led to dramatic decreases in both the number of filings and eviction judgements across the region. However, the eviction moratorium’s official end in Virginia on June 30, 2022, brings about concerns among advocates and service providers over a potential wave of evictions and homelessness in the coming months. The last quarter of 2022 has already seen major increases in evictions that are well on their way to exceeding pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: Average annual eviction filings and orders by locality\n\n\n\nEviction filings should continue to be monitored over the coming months. The RVA Eviction Lab has been at the forefront of this data collection and analysis, and will continue to be a resource for the region in understanding the increasing risks for renters with renter protections and resources coming to an end."

But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the count jumped—going from 497 in 2019 to 834 in 2021, a 68 percent increase.\nThe Urban Institute recently highlighted Homeward’s (the region’s planning and coordinating organization for the GRCoC) efforts to address homelessness during the pandemic. Their response measures served as best practice examples in preventing high transmission rates among people experiencing homelessness as well as direct service staff.\nBut the challenges of reducing homelessness during the pandemic were laid bare. With an eviction moratorium, rental vacancy rates reached record lows—leaving many seeking rental options with little to none. In addition, providers have also referenced landlords setting high security deposits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.11: Greater Richmond CoC Point-in-Time count\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Students experiencing homelessness\nThe McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) Program collects data on students experiencing homelessness, which often can paint a different picture of homelessness when compared to the Point-in-Time counts. In the region, school divisions have been seeing varying numbers, but between the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years students experiencing homelessness have declined across all school divisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining student homelessness\n\n\n\nHomeless children counted under the McKinney-Vento program are defined as “individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.” This includes children who are doubled-up with another households or living in motels, along with those living in shelters, vehicles, public areas, and other unsuitable places. This is more expansive than the definition used for PIT counts.\n\n\nThe most notable declines in student homelessness have been seen in the Richmond Public School system, where the number of students experiencing homelessness have declined by 40 percent from 2017-2018 to 2019-2020. Given the pandemic and virtual learning environments, upcoming McKinney-Vento data through the 2021-2022 school year may need require extra context.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.12: Enrolled students experiencing homelessness by school year"

    "text": "11.2 Demographic and socioeconomic changes\n\n11.2.1 Population changes\nBetween 2010 and 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau has estimated that the City of Richmond has grown by 11 percent — an increase of 22,396 residents. Throughout much of the decade the city has been on a slow upward trend until 2020. The 2020 Census estimate shows a slight decline from the 2019 estimate — a loss of 3,826 residents. This change could be a result of the difficulties associated with undercounts during the 2020 Census.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Richmond city: Total Population\n\n\n\nCensus estimates from 2016 show Richmond gaining more than 2,000 net persons that year who moved from somewhere else in the state or country. However, the city has experienced a net loss in domestic migration since then. The majority of the city’s population growth over the past five years has been due to migration from abroad along with natural increases through new births.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Richmond city: Components of population change\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Household characteristics\nBetween 2016 and 2020, there have been distinct changes between homeowner and renter households in the city. The city has seen a 2,555 increase in homeowner households with no children, while the number of renter household with no children has decreased by 607. At the other end of the spectrum, there has been a significant decrease in renter households with children (-2,192), while there are only 162 fewer homeowner households with children in the city. These trends seem to suggest affordability challenges in the homeownership and rental markets of the city.\nNew homeowners without children (and with fewer financial responsibilities) often find it easier to afford a home, while renters with children are finding it difficulty to afford even a rental — most likely due to lack of larger rental options, as well as increasing costs.\nNonfamily households have seen an increase for both homeowners and renters, but especially for renters (+1,874). This is likely a result of the student population, as well as young professionals, needing additional roommates to afford increasing rents in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Richmond city: Change in households with children by tenure\n\n\n\nSince 2016, the number of seniors (65 years and over) has been on the rise in the city — especially among seniors living alone (+1,695). The rise in seniors living alone is a result of the ongoing desire of older adults to age in place. As this trend continues, so do concerns for senior ability to age in place comfortably with ongoing home maintenance needs or rising rent on fixed incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Richmond city: Change in senior population by living arrangement\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Income and wages\nThere are wide disparities between homeowner and renter incomes in the City of Richmond. The median homeowner household income ($79,858) is over double that of the median renter household income ($36,249). This gap has been persistent in spite of a 16 percent increase in median household income for renters between 2016 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Richmond city: Median houshold income by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Persons with disabilities\nIndependent living difficulties make it necessary for many individuals to seek assisted living facilities or significant modifications to their home to continue to live comfortably. However, both options can be costly — increasing the need for funding of home accessibility rehabilitation or new accessible housing construction.\nSince 2016, there are now over 500 more persons in the city with independent living difficulties. This growth has been among younger adults (under 35) and “young” seniors (65 to 74). The latter group’s growth is likely the result of middle-age adults with these difficulties (which saw a large decline) aging into this category in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Richmond city: Net change in individuals with independent living difficulties by age"

There are more than 9,100 apartments across these properties, which make up approximately 25 percent of all multifamily (two or more units) rental housing in the city.\nOlder NOAH properties command slightly higher rents than those built in 1960 and beyond. Most of the pre-1960 properties are located in the city’s older neighborhoods north of the river, such as Shockoe Bottom and The Fan, and have average rents between $1,000 and $1,400. “Newer” NOAH units built in the 1960s and afterward are generally located in the Northside and Southside areas of the city and have average rents between $750 and $1,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Richmond city: Distribution of average asking rents in NOAH properties by year built"

This was several hundred dollars below what the average asking rent for an apartment was in 2020. Although low-end wage growth has increased the purchasing power of working class households, extra take-home pay is likely to be used up for higher costs of goods—and accelerating rents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Richmond city: Average asking rent versus rent affordable to median renter income\n\n\n\nThe average renter in the city would also be very challenged to find an affordable home to purchase. This gap does not even factor in downpayment savings, credit worthiness, and other important factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.11: Richmond city: Income needed to afford median home price versus median renter income\n\n\n\nBased on HUD Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, there was a shortage of 17,834 rental homes for households making less than 80 percent AMI. This was a deficit increase of 300 homes from 2015 when the shortage was 17,534. The most severe shortage in the City of Richmond is among deeply affordable rentals for households at 30 percent AMI or less.\nBut there has been a growing shortage among higher income households between 31 and 80 percent AMI.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.12: Richmond city: Rental housing gap by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Impact of housing costs\nRising rents have continued to increase the number of renters with cost burden in the city, although there are possible signs of decelerating growth.

Between 2016 and 2020, county population experienced an 8 percent increase — just over 26,000 new residents. As of the 2020 Census, Chesterfield County was the fourth-most populous locality in Virginia — falling only behind the Northern Virginia counties of Fairfax, Prince William, and Loudoun.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Chesterfield County: Total Population\n\n\n\nThe county’s substantial growth in recent years has been directly tied to domestic migration (i.e. people living in the region, state, or nation moving into the county). Between 2020 and 2021, the county increased by 4,402 due to domestic migration. International migration and natural increases pale in comparison and have otherwise been in decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Chesterfield County: Components of population change\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Household characteristics\nThe increasing number of homeowners in the county has been outpacing renters since 2016. Homeowner household increases have been across all types of households — especially those with no children (+3,068). On the other hand, renter increases have mainly been among households with children (+617), while the major decrease in households was among nonfamily renter households (-289).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Chesterfield County: Change in households with children by tenure\n\n\n\nAs with much of the region, the senior population in the county has continued to see major growth. In the county, this growth has mainly been among seniors in family households (mainly those living with a spouse or are the head of household) (+6,566). Growth has also been significant among seniors living alone (+2,687). But declines have only been seen among seniors living with other relatives, which could include a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Chesterfield County: Change in senior population by living arrangement\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.3 Income and wages\nBetween 2016 and 2020, the median renter household income increased by 7 percent, while the median homeowner household income increased 5 percent. In spite of those gains among the typical renter household in the county, renter incomes are nearly half that of a homeowner. The wide gap between between renter and homeowner incomes continues to speak to not only the greater wealth provided by homeownership, but also the continuing affordability challenges faced by renters seeking homeownership opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Chesterfield County: Median houshold income by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.4 Persons with disabilities\nIn Chesterfield County, the number of individuals with independent living difficulties has increased largely among the younger age group (18 to 34 years old). While older age groups saw new increases in individuals with living difficulties of less than 100, the 18 to 34 age group had an increase of 744 individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Chesterfield County: Net change in individuals with independent living difficulties by age"

In spite of a brief decrease towards the end of 2020, home prices in the county have continued to increase amid the pandemic — getting closer and closer to $400,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Chesterfield County: Median home sales price\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Rental\nRental demand has continued to grow over the past five years. As of Q3 2022, the average market asking rent in Chesterfield County was $1,504 — which would require a household to make just over $60,000 to not be cost-burdened. Based on 2020 estimates on median renter household income, this would be a rent affordable to a large swath of the renter population.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Chesterfield County: Average asking rent\n\n\n\nBased on CoStar geographic markets, the Midlothian area represents a distinct rental market from the rest of the county. As of Q3 2022 the average market asking rent for Midlothian was $152 more than the rest of the county. The differences in rent can be attributed to the development of several new multifamily properties and the highly desirable location. With market rate rental development continuing to target this area, geographic disparities may continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Chesterfield County: Average asking rent by submarket\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Housing assistance\nOver the last two and a half years, more than 800 new affordable rental unit subsidies were added in the county.

There are about 3,712 apartments across these properties, which make up approximately 23 percent of all multifamily (two or more units) rental housing in the county.\nThe majority of these properties were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s. These properties command much higher rents than those built pre-1970.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: Chesterfield County: Distribution of average asking rents in NOAH properties by year built\n\n\n\nThis estimate does not include manufactured home communities which could also be considered NOAH properties because of their deep affordability without public subsidy. Chesterfield County still remains the region’s foremost location for manufactured home communities — with at least 1,543 homes spread out across 13 communities.\nSince the release of the Framework, Bermuda Estates, located along the county’s Route 1 corridor, was purchased by project:HOMES. This initiative was taken upon by project:HOMES in order to stabilize the community and since the acquisition, they have made significant infrastructure improvements, replaced homes, conducted noteworthy community engagement, and placed a community center.\nThis stands in contrast to private activity in some of Chesterfield County’s largest manufactured home communities, Suburban Village and Shady Hill. Suburban Village was purchased in early 2021 by a real estate investment firm, while Shady Hill Mobile Home Park recently accepted a purchase offer in Summer 2022. Both acquisitions have raised concerns among residents and advocates for significant rent increases and potential redevelopment.\n\n\n\n\nTable 12.2:  Manufactured home communities in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Community name \n    Estimated units \n  \n \n\n  \n    Greenleigh Mobile Home Park \n    502 \n  \n  \n    Harbour East Village \n    260 \n  \n  \n    Suburban Mobile Village \n    226 \n  \n  \n    Holiday Mobile Home Park \n    133 \n  \n  \n    Shady Hill Mobile Home Park \n    110 \n  \n  \n    El Rancho Trailer Court \n    55 \n  \n  \n    Conner Homes \n    54 \n  \n  \n    Plantation Mobile Homes \n    48 \n  \n  \n    Bellwood Mobile Home Park \n    41 \n  \n  \n    Falling Creek Mobile Home Park \n    35 \n  \n  \n    Parkway Trailer Court \n    28 \n  \n  \n    Ponderosa Mobile Home Park \n    27 \n  \n  \n    Carneal's Trailer Park \n    24"

    "text": "12.4 Gap analysis\n\n12.4.1 Affordability of current housing stock\nIn Chesterfield County, the median renter household income is just enough to afford the average market asking rent. In 2020, the rent affordable based on the median renter household income was $1,328, while the average asking rent was $1,265 — meaning that the typical renter could afford $63 more than the average asking rent.\nThis difference between affordable rent and asking rent has been shrinking in recent years. From a difference of $89 in 2016 to $63 in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Chesterfield County: Average asking rent versus rent affordable to median renter income\n\n\n\nAlthough a typical renter can more easily find an affordable rental, if they are looking to move onto homeownership, they face a wider gap to cross.\nIn Chesterfield County, median renter household incomes have not been enough to afford the median sales price in the county from 2016 to 2020. In 2020, the gap between renter income and the income needed to afford the median priced home was $8,800. This is an increase of nearly $800 from the gap in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: Chesterfield County: Income needed to afford median home price versus median renter income\n\n\n\nAcross renter households with incomes below 80 percent AMI, the gap in affordable housing has increased by 204 units from 2015 to 2018 — for a total shortage of 7,569 rental units affordable to households making 80 percent AMI or less. This estimated gap is based on matching renter income to rental housing affordable to that income and should be considered with some caution.\nHousehold incomes matching housing costs does not necessarily reflect that a household is able to afford housing costs given the numerous other financial responsibilities held by individuals and families. Nonetheless, the estimated gap provides our closest assessment of a gap in housing at specific income-levels.\nFor Chesterfield County, the gap has increased most significantly for households between 51 and 80 percent AMI — suggesting a growing need for affordable housing for higher income households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: Chesterfield County: Rental housing gap by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n12.4.2 Impact of housing costs\nFrom 2015 to 2019, the number of cost burden homeowners has been in decline. By 2019, there was a total decline of 2,660 cost-burdened homeowners from 2015 estimates. But during this same timeframe, the number of cost-burdened renters has increased by 1,161. The disparate changes in cost burden in Chesterfield County speak to growing affordability issues for renters and greater stability for existing homeowners.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.14: Chesterfield County: Cumulative change in cost-burdened households by tenure\n\n\n\nPre-pandemic eviction filings were typically above 500 each month, while eviction judgements were made were nearly half of those filings. The pandemic protections signficantly decreased filings to nearly a third of pre-pandemic numbers. Eviction judgements remained low throughout much of 2021, but filings and judgements saw increases in the early part of 2022 — signalling the potential for greater renter instability as pandemic renter protections end. Filings are already on their way to surpassing pre-pandemic numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.15: Chesterfield County: Evictions filings and judgements"

Regardless of these differences, both submarkets experienced significant increases in average asking rent since the start of the pandemic. Eastern Henrico had a 27 percent increase, while Western Henrico had a 30 percent increase in average asking rent.\nThis major rental increase was no doubt a result of tightening rental market amid pandemic eviction protections, as well as an increasing desire to leave denser urban environments during the height of COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Henrico County: Average asking rent by submarket\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Housing assistance\nOver the last two and a half years, more than 1,202 new affordable rental unit subsidies were added in the county.

At this point in time, the average asking rent was $1,222 — only $20 more.\nThe difference between rent affordable to the typical renter and the average rent in the county has been narrowing since 2016 — when the difference was roughly $65.\nAlthough it may seem as Henrico County is becoming more and more affordable to renters, it is increasingly the trend that more and more higher income households are choosing to rent out of necessity or lifestyle preference. As rents continue to rise and wage increases slow, we may soon see that average rents are greater than the median renter household income in Henrico.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: Henrico County: Average asking rent versus rent affordable to median renter income\n\n\n\nAttaining homeownership has generally been harder with the median renter incomes. Before 2020, average renter incomes were not enough to afford the median-priced home in the county. As rates dropped in 2020, renters could compete more confidently in the market—but this is likely no longer the case as rates (and prices) have risen significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: Henrico County: Median sales price versus maximum home price affordable to median renter income\n\n\n\nThe shortage of rental housing for households making 80 percent AMI and below has grown between 2015 and 2018 — from 12,030 in 2015 to 12,184 in 2018.

This was a greater decrease than the town’s last recorded population decrease between 2010 and 2011, when the town population declined by 38.

This rent is $275 more than what the average asking rent in 2020 was.\nAlthough this suggests that renters in the town are more able to afford rental housing, it could also point to lower income renter households having to move elsewhere in order to afford housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.10: Town of Ashland: Rental housing gap\n\n\n\nIn spite of increasing incomes among renters in the town, the high price of homeownership continues to keep renters from moving to more permanent tenureship. In 2016. the gap between income needed to afford the median home price and the typical renter income was just over $17,000. By 2020, that gap had only decreased by about $2,000 — leaving the typical renter $15,241 away from being able to afford the median home price in 2020 ($305,000).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.11: Town of Ashland: Income needed to afford median home price versus median renter income\n\n\n\nIn contrast to other localities, homeowner cost burden has increased in Ashland. From 2015 to 2019, there has been an increase of 57 cost-burdened homeowner households — a 19 percent increase. However, the number of cost-burdened renter households decreased from 690 to 580 — a 16 percent decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.12: Town of Ashland: Cost burden by tenure"

These changes reflect a trend among many Virginia rural localities as job opportunities leave and fewer and fewer adults have children.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: Charles City County: Total Population\n\n\n\nThe components of population change for Charles City County showed that, in 2016 and 2017, people were moving to the county from other parts of the state or country. But natural decreases have consistently outpaced any and all growth within the county until 2021, when domestic migration joined natural decreases in contributing to the county’s population loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.2: Charles City County: Components of population change\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2 Household characteristics\nThe changes in household types in Charles City County have been only a fraction of the overall population. But from 2016 to 2020, there has been an overall decrease in households with children in the county — both among homeowners and renters (-48). The only major increaes has been among nonfamily homeowner households (+146). This is most likely attributable to an increasing number of seniors living alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.3: Charles City County: Change in households with children by tenure\n\n\n\nThe senior population in the county increased by 251 between 2016 and 2020.

When adjusted for inflation, homeowner median household income has only increased by 2 percent — from $65,077 in 2016 to $66,719 in 2020.\nRenters in the county have seen a decrease in median household income by 22 percent — falling nearly $10,000 to $33,661 in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.5: Charles City County: Median houshold income by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Persons with disabilities\nIndividuals with independent living difficulties have increased largely among the 65 year and older age group. In total, there has been an increase of 67 individuals with independent living difficulties at this age between 2016 and 2020.

The development of West Creek Business Park and with it the headquarters for major employers such as CarMax and Capital One has led to increasing demand for housing at the eastern edge of the county. The market has responded with luxury multifamily developments such as The Retreat at West Creek and Tuckahoe Pines and there are at least 1,700 more units on the way.\nThe increasing rental demand has been apparent in high average asking rent in Goochland County. As of 2022 Q3, average asking rent in the county was $2,208. Adjusting for inflation shows despite what appears to be a 24 percent increase in rent from 2016 Q1 to 2022 Q3, the value of the dollar has changed in such a way that rent then and now has changed very little.

The share of renters residing single-family homes has decreased as the number of multifamily properties has increased, but there has also been a raw decrease in single-family renters (from 935 in 2016 to 838 in 2020).

The gap between median renter household income and average asking rent in 2016 was $752. By 2020, that gap had increased by $10 — continuing to leave the typical renter hundreds of dollars short of affording the typical rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.10: Goochland County: Average asking rent versus rent affordable to median renter income\n\n\n\n. For renters to afford homeownership, the income needed to afford the the median priced home is a steep economic climb. In 2016, a household needed to make roughly $87,483 to afford the median sales price, but a renter’s median household income was only $40,915.

    "text": "19.2 Demographic and socioeconomic changes\n\n19.2.1 Population changes\nDespite a dip in population from 2014 to 2015, Powhatan County has been on an upward trend for the most part. In 2020, the county reached a population of 30,333 — an overall increase of 8 percent since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: Powhatan County: Total Population\n\n\n\nLike many other rural counties in the region, Powhatan County’s population growth in recent years has been due to domestic migration. Between 2020 and 2021, 772 new residents came to the county from somewhere else within the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: Powhatan County: Components of population change\n\n\n\n\n\n19.2.2 Household characteristics\nThe county has seen a decreasing number of renter households across the board. But homeowners continue to come to the county — especially homeowner households with no children. By 2020, there was an estimated 590 more homeowners with no children than in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3: Powhatan County: Change in households with children by tenure\n\n\n\nThe greatest increases in the senior population in the county have been among seniors in family households (either living with a spouse or are the head of household). In contrast to other localities, Powhatan County is seeing a decline in seniors in nonfamily households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.4: Powhatan County: Change in senior population by living arrangement\n\n\n\n\n\n19.2.3 Income and wages\nBoth homeowner and renter median household income has been on the incline from 2016 to 2020 in the county. For homeowners, there has been an increase of 8 percent, while renters experienced a 20 percent increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.5: Powhatan County: Median houshold income by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n19.2.4 Persons with disabilities\nIn the county, there has been an increase in individuals with independent living difficulties that are 65 years old and older (+204) between 2016 and 2020. For individuals younger than 65, there has been a decline in individuals with independent living difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.6: Powhatan County: Net change in individuals with independent living difficulties by age"

From a low of $283,507 in March 2017 to a high of $522,181 in May 2022, median home price in the county has increased nearly 84 percent. Although the over $500,000 median home price may represent a seasonal spike, median home price has generally been trending upward and likely to stay above $500,000 in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.7: Powhatan County: Median home sales price\n\n\n\n\n\n19.3.2 Rental\nRenter households have been in decline since 2016 when roughly one in ten households in the county were renters. This share has dropped by four percentage points down to 7 percent renter household in 2020. Despite the declining number of renter households in the county, 2021 saw the completion of 200 new rental units at the eastern edge of the county.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.8: Renter households in Powhatan County\n\n\n\nCoStar lists three multifamily properties in the county; two are located along Old Buckingham Road near the county seat, while the third is located at the eastern edge of the county near Midlothian. There was a 39 year period between the construction of both Powhatan Apartment buildings and the Artistry.\nThe development of the Artistry at Winterfield potentially represents growing housing demand from the western edge of Chesterfield County’s Midlothian community. This luxury multifamily property has an average asking rent of $1,888.\n\n\n\n\nTable 19.1:  Powhatan County: Multifamily properties \n \n  \n    Property name \n    Year built \n    CoStar rating \n    Vacancy rate \n    Units \n  \n \n\n  \n    Artistry at Winterfield \n    2021 \n    4 \n    7.8% \n    200 \n  \n  \n    Powhatan Apartments \n    1982 \n    2 \n    4.6% \n    11 \n  \n  \n    Powhatan Apartments \n    1982 \n    3 \n    4.6% \n    11 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.3.3 Housing assistance\nThe National Housing Preservation Database lists no federally-assisted housing properties in New Kent County.\n\n\n19.3.4 Naturally-occurring affordable housing\nPowhatan Apartments (both locations) represent the county’s naturally-occurring affordable housing based on the definition of NOAH outlined in this report. Rent data is unavailable for Powhatan Apartments via CoStar.\nIn addition to Powhatan Apartments, there is a small manufactured home community located near the cross roads of Maidens Road (US-522) and Huguenot Trail that consists of at least six homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.9: Powhatan County: Manufactured home communities"

    "text": "19.4 Gap analysis\n\n19.4.1 Affordability of current housing stock\nWith increasing renter household incomes in the county, the gap between income needed to afford the typical home price and typical renter income has been narrowing. In 2016, the gap stood at nearly $12,000, but by 2020 the gap had decreased to just below $7,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.10: Powhatan County: Income needed to afford median home priceversus median renter income\n\n\n\nAs of 2018, there was a 70 unit rental home shortage for households making less than 80 percent AMI. This was a major decline from 2015 when the shortage was 215 — mainly for 30 percent AMI or less households. The deficit has decreased significantly among extremely and very low-income households, but has increased for higher income households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.11: Powhatan County: Rental housing gap by AMI\n\n\n\n\n\n19.4.2 Impact of housing costs\nThe share of cost-burdened renters has decreased from nearly 38 percent of renter households to 26 percent in a short period. For homeowners, the share of cost-burdened households has decreased by 8 percentage points — going from 24 percent to 16 percent over four years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.12: Powhatan County: Share of cost-burdened households by tenure\n\n\n\nAvailable data from William and Mary’s Project HOPE shows that the number of enrolled students experiencing homelessness in the county has increased in recent years. The county’s McKinney-Vento Act data showed that the number of students experiencing homeless has doubled from the 2016-2017 school year when the number was 15. By the 2019-2020, that number was 29.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.13: Powhatan CountyEnrolled students experiencing homelessness by school year"
