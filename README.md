This repository contains all material for a data update of the Richmond Regional Housing Framework for the Partnership for Housing Affordability (PHA).

## Background

The Richmond Regional Housing Framework was completed by HDAdvisors (HDA) in 2016. In 2021, PHA requested that HDA "refresh" the data used in the 2016 Regional Framework to show the progress made in terms of affordable housing in the region.
