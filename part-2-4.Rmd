# Utilize the same filters as the Chesterfield County Rental Market Analysis. I've changed the star rating to two or less, which coincides with CoStar's analysis.

# CoStar Filters for Properties: Multi-Family, Localities: Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico,Richmondy City; Construction status: Existing; Stars: 2 or less; Rent type: Market; Max Year Built: 1999

# This returns a total of 478 properties.

# There are about 80 properties that do not have a listed style. Some may be manufactured home parks.

# Append data from MHCCV report for manufactured home communities.
